0,io.bytes.per.checksum,472008331,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis,600000,The time for which retry cache entries are retained.
2,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
3,dfs.client.read.striped.threadpool.size,18,"The maximum number of threads used for parallel reading
    in striped layout."
4,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
5,dfs.namenode.name.cache.threshold,10,"Frequently accessed files that are accessed more times than this
    threshold are cached in the FSDirectory nameCache."
6,ipc.client.connect.timeout,20000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for the
               socket to establish a server connection."
7,dfs.namenode.file.close.num-committed-allowed,0,"Normally a file can only be closed with all its blocks are committed.
    When this value is set to a positive integer N, a file can be closed
    when N blocks are committed and the rest complete."
8,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
9,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
