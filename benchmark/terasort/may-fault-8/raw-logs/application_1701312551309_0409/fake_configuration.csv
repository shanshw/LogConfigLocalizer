0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts,45,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make on socket timeout
               to establish a server connection."
2,yarn.sharedcache.store.in-memory.staleness-period-mins,10080,
3,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
4,dfs.mover.movedWinWidth,5400000,"The minimum time interval, in milliseconds, that a block can be
    moved to another location again."
5,yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.delete-delay-ms,20,
6,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.read.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for reading.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
7,dfs.qjournal.get-journal-state.timeout.ms,120000,"Timeout in milliseconds when calling getJournalState().
    JournalNodes."
8,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
9,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
