0,dfs.client.read.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1382031381,Threshold in milliseconds for read entries during short-circuit local reads.
1,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,3,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
3,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,8192,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
4,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
    speed of quota initialization also affects the namenode fail-over latency.
    If the size of name space is big, try increasing this to 16 or higher."
5,dfs.datanode.block.id.layout.upgrade.threads,6,"The number of threads to use when creating hard links from
    current to previous blocks during upgrade of a DataNode to block ID-based
    block layout (see HDFS-6482 for details on the layout)."
6,dfs.namenode.list.encryption.zones.num.responses,100,"When listing encryption zones, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
7,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,10000,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
8,dfs.namenode.reencrypt.edek.threads,10,"Maximum number of re-encrypt threads to contact the KMS
    and re-encrypt the edeks."
9,dfs.qjournal.queued-edits.limit.mb,10,Queue size in MB for quorum journal edits.
