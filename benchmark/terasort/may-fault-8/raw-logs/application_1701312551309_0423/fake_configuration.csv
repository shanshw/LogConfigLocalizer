0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-718022840,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.handler,1,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    HANDLER phase which do not involve holding a lock.
    See org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProcessingDetails.Timing for more details on
    this phase. This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
2,hadoop.security.uid.cache.secs,14400,"This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache
        containing the userId to userName and groupId to groupName used by
        NativeIO getFstat()."
3,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
4,dfs.namenode.lease-recheck-interval-ms,2000,"During the release of lease a lock is hold that make any
    operations on the namenode stuck. In order to not block them during
    a too long duration we stop releasing lease after this max lock limit."
5,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
6,ha.health-monitor.check-interval.ms,1000,How often to check the service.
7,mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during combine output collection
   before sending a progress notification."
8,dfs.client.write.max-packets-in-flight,80,The maximum number of DFSPackets allowed in flight.
9,ipc.client.connect.max.retries,10,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make to establish
               a server connection."
