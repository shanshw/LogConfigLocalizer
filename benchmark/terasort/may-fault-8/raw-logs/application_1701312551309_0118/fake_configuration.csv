0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."
2,mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval,1000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
3,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
    speed of quota initialization also affects the namenode fail-over latency.
    If the size of name space is big, try increasing this to 16 or higher."
4,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.group.hierarchy.levels,0,"The number of levels to go up the group hierarchy when determining
    which groups a user is part of. 0 Will represent checking just the
    group that the user belongs to.  Each additional level will raise the
    time it takes to execute a query by at most
    hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout.
    The default will usually be appropriate for all LDAP systems."
5,dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum,1,The minimum number of redundant NameNode storage volumes required.
6,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.idle.sleep.ms,10000,The sleep time of DeadNodeDetector per iteration.
7,ipc.client.connect.retry.interval,1000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for
    before retrying to establish a server connection."
8,dfs.client.retry.times.get-last-block-length,3,Number of retries for calls to fetchLocatedBlocksAndGetLastBlockLength().
9,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
