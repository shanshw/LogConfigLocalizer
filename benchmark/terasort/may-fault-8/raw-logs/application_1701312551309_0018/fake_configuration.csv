0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1385217344,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."
2,mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
3,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
4,dfs.balancer.getBlocks.size,2147483648,"Total size in bytes of Datanode blocks to get when fetching a source's
    block list."
5,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
6,dfs.batched.ls.limit,100,"Limit the number of paths that can be listed in a single batched
    listing call. printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
7,fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer,8192,Socket send buffer hint to amazon connector. Represented in bytes.
8,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
9,hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.size,500,Size of the EncryptedKeyVersion cache Queue for each key
