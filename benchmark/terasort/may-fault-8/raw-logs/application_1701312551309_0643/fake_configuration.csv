0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize,0,"The minimum size chunk that map input should be split
  into.  Note that some file formats may have minimum split sizes that
  take priority over this setting."
2,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."

    app master."

5,mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms,604800000,"Job history files older than this many milliseconds will
  be deleted when the history cleaner runs. Defaults to 604800000 (1 week)."
6,dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc,1000,"Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client
    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"
7,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
8,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.read.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for reading.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
