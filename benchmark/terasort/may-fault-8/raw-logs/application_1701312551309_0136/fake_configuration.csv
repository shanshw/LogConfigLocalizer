0,io.bytes.per.checksum,350364053,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,8192,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
2,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
3,yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms,0,
4,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."
5,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
6,ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries,1,"The number of retries on connect error when establishing RPC proxy
    connection to NameNode, used for monitorHealth() calls."
7,dfs.namenode.lease-hard-limit-sec,1200,Determines the namenode automatic lease recovery interval in seconds.
8,mapreduce.jobhistory.move.thread-count,3,The number of threads used to move files.
9,dfs.client.socketcache.expiryMsec,3000,Socket cache expiration for short-circuit reads in msec.
