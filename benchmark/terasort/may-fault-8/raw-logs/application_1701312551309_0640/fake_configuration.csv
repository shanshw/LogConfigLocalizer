2,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when
      BlockConstructionStage is
      PIPELINE_SETUP_CREATE and clientName is empty.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."

    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."
