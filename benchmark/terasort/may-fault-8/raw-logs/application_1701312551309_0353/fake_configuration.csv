0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1216356860,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout,60000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it stays in finishing state for too long.
  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
  it will be transitioned to finishing state. That will give a chance for the
  task to exit by itself."
2,dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms,3600000,"The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated.

    By default this parameter is set to 1 hour.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

6,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with

    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer."
