0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-2145503254,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.max.disks.to.report,5,"Number of disks to include in JSON report per operation. We will return
    disks with the highest latency."
2,yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb,1024,
3,dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved,104857600,"The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory
    in bytes. The default is 100MB. Support multiple size unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
4,fs.s3a.executor.capacity,16,"The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."
5,ipc.ping.interval,60000,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  The client will send ping when the interval is passed without receiving bytes,
  if ipc.client.ping is set to true."

7,dfs.balancer.max-iteration-time,1200000,"Maximum amount of time while an iteration can be run by the Balancer. After
    this time the Balancer will stop the iteration, and reevaluate the work
    needs to be done to Balance the cluster. The default value is 20 minutes."
8,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,15000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
9,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval,3,"Minimum number of missed heartbeats intervals for a datanode to
    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."
