  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts,5,"The maximum number of times a URL will be read for providing job
    end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to limit how long
    after end of a job, the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be

    1MB. Values of the length less than the chunk size is
    guaranteed to have known value length in read time (See also
    TFile.Reader.Scanner.Entry.isValueLengthKnown())."
4,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode

    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
