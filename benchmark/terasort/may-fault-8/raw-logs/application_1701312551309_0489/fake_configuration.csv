0,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,-1960514541,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
1,net.topology.script.number.args,100,"The max number of args that the script configured with
    net.topology.script.file.name should be run with. Each arg is an
    IP address."
2,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
3,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
4,fs.ftp.timeout,0,FTP filesystem's timeout in seconds.
5,dfs.client.retry.times.get-last-block-length,3,Number of retries for calls to fetchLocatedBlocksAndGetLastBlockLength().
6,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
7,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."

9,dfs.namenode.blockreport.queue.size,1024,The queue size of BlockReportProcessingThread in BlockManager.
