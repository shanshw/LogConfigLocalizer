  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."

3,file.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

5,dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.errors,5,"During a block move from a source to destination disk, we might
      encounter various errors. This defines how many errors we can tolerate
      before we declare a move between 2 disks (or a step) has failed."
6,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

8,dfs.namenode.list.reencryption.status.num.responses,100,"When listing re-encryption status, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
