0,hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload.threads,NUhZ9,"Only relevant if hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload is true.
    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."
1,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."
2,hadoop.security.key.default.bitlength,128,"The length (bits) of keys we want the KeyProvider to produce. Key length
    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."
3,dfs.ha.tail-edits.rolledits.timeout,60,The timeout in seconds of calling rollEdits RPC on Active NN.
4,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.max.outstanding.paths,10000,"Defines the maximum number of paths to satisfy that can be queued up in the
    Satisfier call queue in a period of time. Default value is 10000."
5,dfs.namenode.replication.min,1,Minimal block replication.
6,dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report,5,"Number of nodes to include in JSON report. We will return nodes with
    the highest number of votes from peers."
7,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
8,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.disks,5,Minimum number of disks to run outlier detection.
9,dfs.datanode.max.slowdisks.to.exclude,0,"The number of slow disks that needs to be excluded. By default, this parameter is set to 0,
    which disables excluding slow disk when choosing volume."
