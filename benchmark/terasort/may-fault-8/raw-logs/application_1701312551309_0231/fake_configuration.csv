0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.webhdfs.netty.high.watermark,65535,High watermark configuration to Netty for Datanode WebHdfs.
2,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
3,dfs.datanode.peer.metrics.min.outlier.detection.samples,1000,"Minimum number of packet send samples which are required to qualify for outlier detection.
      If the number of samples is below this then outlier detection is skipped."
4,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
5,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.task.listener.thread-count,30,"The number of threads used to handle RPC calls in the
    MR AppMaster from remote tasks"
7,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
8,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
9,dfs.block.scanner.volume.join.timeout.ms,5000,"The amount of time in milliseconds that the BlockScanner times out waiting
    for the VolumeScanner thread to join during a shutdown call."
