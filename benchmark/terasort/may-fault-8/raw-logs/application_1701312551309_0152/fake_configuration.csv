  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.qjournal.parallel-read.num-threads,5,Number of threads per JN to be used for tailing edits.
2,dfs.client.socketcache.expiryMsec,3000,Socket cache expiration for short-circuit reads in msec.
3,yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.retry-interval-ms,1000,
4,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,The number of virtual CPU cores the MR AppMaster needs.
5,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."

8,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms,30000,"When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache
    something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by
    sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode

    resend these commands."

      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
