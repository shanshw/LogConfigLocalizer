0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-752891587,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
2,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."
3,yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.limit.kb,0,"Maximum size of the syslog.shuffle file in kilobytes
    (0 for no limit)."
4,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
5,hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload.threads,3,"Only relevant if hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload is true.
    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."
6,dfs.namenode.delegation.key.update-interval,86400000,"The update interval for master key for delegation tokens 
       in the namenode in milliseconds."
7,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout,10000,"The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a
    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."
8,hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count,1,Number of time to retry connecting to KMS on authentication failure
9,hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.expiry,43200000,"Cache expiry time for a Key, after which the cache Queue for this
    key will be dropped. Default = 12hrs"
