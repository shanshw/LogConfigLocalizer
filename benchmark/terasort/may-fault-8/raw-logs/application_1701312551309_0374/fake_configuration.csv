0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms,10000,Number of milliseconds to wait before the job client kills the application.
2,dfs.namenode.write-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a write lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
3,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."
4,dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels,0,"Maximum no of the skip levels to be maintained in the skip list for
    storing directory snapshot diffs. By default, it is set to 0 and a linear
    list will be used to store the directory snapshot diffs."
5,file.blocksize,67108864,Block size
6,ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.rpc-timeout.ms,5000,Timeout that the FC waits for the old active to go to standby
7,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
8,dfs.namenode.max-lock-hold-to-release-lease-ms,25,"During the release of lease a lock is hold that make any
    operations on the namenode stuck. In order to not block them during
    a too long duration we stop releasing lease after this max lock limit."
9,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file,10000,"Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on
        write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can
        degrade performance."
