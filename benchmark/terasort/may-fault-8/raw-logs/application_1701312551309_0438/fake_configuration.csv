0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.qjournal.start-segment.timeout.ms,20000,Quorum timeout in milliseconds for starting a log segment.
2,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
3,dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc,1000,"Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client
    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"
4,yarn.resourcemanager.delegation.key.update-interval,86400000,
5,ipc.server.purge.interval,15,"Define how often calls are cleaned up in the server.
    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
6,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
7,dfs.namenode.blockreport.queue.size,1024,The queue size of BlockReportProcessingThread in BlockManager.
8,dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,"Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent."
9,ipc.[port_number].scheduler.priority.levels,4,"How many priority levels to use within the scheduler and call
    queue. This property applies to RpcScheduler and CallQueue."
