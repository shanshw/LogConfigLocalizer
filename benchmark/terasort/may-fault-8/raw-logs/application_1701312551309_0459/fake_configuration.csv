0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,0,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  If ipc.client.ping is set to true and this rpc-timeout is greater than
  the value of ipc.ping.interval, the effective value of the rpc-timeout is
  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
2,dfs.datanode.data.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for writing block or pipeline
      recovery when
      BlockConstructionStage is PIPELINE_SETUP_APPEND_RECOVERY or PIPELINE_SETUP_STREAMING_RECOVERY.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
3,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
4,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
5,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level,16,"Uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
    segments, each governed by its own write lock."
6,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
7,ipc.[port_number].scheduler.priority.levels,4,"How many priority levels to use within the scheduler and call
    queue. This property applies to RpcScheduler and CallQueue."
8,yarn.resourcemanager.rm.container-allocation.expiry-interval-ms,600000,
9,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,2,Hard limit for the number of replication streams other than those with highest-priority.
