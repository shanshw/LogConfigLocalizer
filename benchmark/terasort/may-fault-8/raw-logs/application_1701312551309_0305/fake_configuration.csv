0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,The number of virtual CPU cores the MR AppMaster needs.
2,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
3,dfs.webhdfs.ugi.expire.after.access,600000,"How long in milliseconds after the last access
      the cached UGI will expire. With 0, never expire."
4,yarn.timeline-service.writer.async.queue.capacity,100,
5,yarn.client.nodemanager-connect.max-wait-ms,180000,
6,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
7,dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved,104857600,"The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory
    in bytes. The default is 100MB. Support multiple size unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
8,yarn.resourcemanager.max-log-aggregation-diagnostics-in-memory,10,
9,file.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
