0,mapreduce.task.timeout,0.40565795,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
1,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
2,fs.ftp.timeout,0,FTP filesystem's timeout in seconds.
3,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.docker.userremapping-uid-threshold,1,
4,mapreduce.client.submit.file.replication,10,"The replication level for submitted job files.  This
  should be around the square root of the number of nodes."
5,dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception,5,"When the balancer is executed as a long-running service, it will retry upon encountering an exception. This
    configuration determines how many times it will retry before considering the exception to be fatal and quitting."

7,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockshared,10,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the

    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
