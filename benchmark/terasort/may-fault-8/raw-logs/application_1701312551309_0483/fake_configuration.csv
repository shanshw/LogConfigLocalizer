0,file.bytes-per-checksum,LoGvv,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  file.stream-buffer-size"
1,mapreduce.am.max-attempts,2,"The maximum number of application attempts. It is a
  application-specific setting. It should not be larger than the global number
  set by resourcemanager. Otherwise, it will be override. The default number is
  set to 2, to allow at least one retry for AM."

4,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries-on-timeouts,3,"The number of client retries on socket timeouts to the AM - before
    reconnecting to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during

5,dfs.namenode.read-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a read lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
6,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
7,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
