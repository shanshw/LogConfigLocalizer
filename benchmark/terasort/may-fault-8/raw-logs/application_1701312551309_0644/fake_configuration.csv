0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."
2,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."

               socket to establish a server connection."

  be deleted when the history cleaner runs. Defaults to 604800000 (1 week)."
8,dfs.blockreport.initialDelay,0,"Delay for first block report in seconds. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If
    no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed"
