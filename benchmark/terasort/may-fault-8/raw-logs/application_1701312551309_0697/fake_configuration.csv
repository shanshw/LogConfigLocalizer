3,hadoop.caller.context.signature.max.size,40,"The caller's signature (optional) is for offline validation. If the
      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."

5,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size,1048576,Buffer size in bytes for short-circuit local reads.
6,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."
