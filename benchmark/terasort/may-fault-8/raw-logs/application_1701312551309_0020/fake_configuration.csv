    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer."
