0,io.bytes.per.checksum,303273923,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker,3,"The number of task-failures on a node manager of a given job
               after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. It
               MUST be less than mapreduce.map.maxattempts and
               mapreduce.reduce.maxattempts otherwise the failed task will
               never be tried on a different node."
2,yarn.nodemanager.node-attributes.provider.fetch-interval-ms,600000,
3,dfs.datanode.restart.replica.expiration,50,"During shutdown for restart, the amount of time in seconds budgeted for
    datanode restart."
4,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.ms,0,Refreshing LocatedBlocks period. A value of 0 disables the feature.
5,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
6,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
7,yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms,5000,
8,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
9,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."
