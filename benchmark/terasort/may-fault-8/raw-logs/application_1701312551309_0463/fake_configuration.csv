    accepted by the client. Messages larger than this value are rejected
    immediately to avoid possible OOMs. This setting should rarely need to be

    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.base.millis

  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
