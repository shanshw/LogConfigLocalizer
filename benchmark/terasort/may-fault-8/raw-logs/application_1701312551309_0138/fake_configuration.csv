0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.snapshotdiff.listing.limit,1000,"Limit the number of entries generated by getSnapshotDiffReportListing within
    one rpc call to the namenode.If less or equal to zero, at most
    DFS_NAMENODE_SNAPSHOT_DIFF_LISTING_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be sent
    across to the client within one rpc call."
2,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,The maximum number of arrays allowed for each array length.
3,fs.ftp.host.port,21,FTP filesystem connects to fs.ftp.host on this port
4,dfs.namenode.service.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from DataNodes and from all other non-client nodes.
  dfs.namenode.service.handler.count will be valid only if
  dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is configured."
5,ipc.server.purge.interval,15,"Define how often calls are cleaned up in the server.
    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
6,yarn.client.max-cached-nodemanagers-proxies,0,
7,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
8,hadoop.caller.context.signature.max.size,40,"The caller's signature (optional) is for offline validation. If the
      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."
9,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
