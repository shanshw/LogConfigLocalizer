    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
