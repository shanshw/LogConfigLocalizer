0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1319447196,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."

    for the VolumeScanner thread to join during a shutdown call."

          SequenceFiles."

      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize."

    active (uploading, or queued to the central FileSystem

    This stops a single stream overloading the shared thread pool."
