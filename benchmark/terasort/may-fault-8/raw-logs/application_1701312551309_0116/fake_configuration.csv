               after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. It
               MUST be less than mapreduce.map.maxattempts and

6,io.file.buffer.size,4096,"The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
7,dfs.datanode.cached-dfsused.check.interval.ms,600000,"The interval check time of loading DU_CACHE_FILE in each volume.
    When the cluster doing the rolling upgrade operations, it will
    usually lead dfsUsed cache file of each volume expired and redo the
    du operations in datanode and that makes datanode start slowly. Adjust
    this property can make cache file be available for the time as you want."
8,dfs.namenode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the NameNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    NameNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    NameNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
9,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
