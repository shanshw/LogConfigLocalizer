0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.parallelcopies,5,"The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce
  during the copy(shuffle) phase."
2,hadoop.caller.context.signature.max.size,40,"The caller's signature (optional) is for offline validation. If the
      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."
3,hadoop.security.kms.client.authentication.retry-count,1,Number of time to retry connecting to KMS on authentication failure
4,yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.max-queue-length,15,
5,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout,60000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it stays in finishing state for too long.
  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
  it will be transitioned to finishing state. That will give a chance for the
  task to exit by itself."
6,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive,100,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."

8,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-threshold,128,"The count threshold for each array length so that a manager is created only after the
    allocation count exceeds the threshold. In other words, the particular array length
    is not managed until the allocation count exceeds the threshold."
9,dfs.namenode.block.deletion.increment,1000,"The number of block deletion increment.
      This setting will control the block increment deletion rate to
      ensure that other waiters on the lock can get in."
