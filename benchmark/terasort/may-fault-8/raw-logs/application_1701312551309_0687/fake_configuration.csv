    one rpc call to the namenode.If less or equal to zero, at most
    DFS_NAMENODE_SNAPSHOT_DIFF_LISTING_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be sent

2,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
3,dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes,4194304,"While reading block files, if the Hadoop native libraries are available,
        the datanode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly
        page data into the operating system buffer cache ahead of the current
        reader's position. This can improve performance especially when
        disks are highly contended.

        This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current
        read position which the datanode will attempt to read ahead. This
        feature may be disabled by configuring this property to 0.

        If the native libraries are not available, this configuration has no
        effect."

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,

9,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
