    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA

  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware

  buffered during read and write operations."

      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."
