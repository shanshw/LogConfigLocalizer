0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,15000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
2,dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration,2,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer."
3,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
4,ipc.ping.interval,60000,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  The client will send ping when the interval is passed without receiving bytes,
  if ipc.client.ping is set to true."
5,dfs.namenode.safemode.extension,30000,"Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
6,dfs.content-summary.sleep-microsec,500,"The length of time in microseconds to put the thread to sleep, between reaquiring the locks
    in content summary computation."
7,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
8,hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity,36000,"Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed."
9,dfs.qjournal.select-input-streams.timeout.ms,20000,Timeout in milliseconds for accepting streams from JournalManagers.
