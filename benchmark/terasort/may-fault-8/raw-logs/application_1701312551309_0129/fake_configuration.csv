2,ipc.maximum.data.length,134217728,"This indicates the maximum IPC message length (bytes) that can be
    accepted by the server. Messages larger than this value are rejected by the
    immediately to avoid possible OOMs. This setting should rarely need to be
    changed."
3,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
4,dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec,21600000,Determines block reporting interval in milliseconds.
5,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources,0,"The maximum number of resources a map reduce job is allowed to
    submit for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command
    line arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."

    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If

    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
