  each map task."
2,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
3,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."
