0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.attempts,0,"The number of times the submitter of the job wants to retry job
    end notification if it fails. This is capped by
    mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts"
2,hadoop.security.key.default.bitlength,128,"The length (bits) of keys we want the KeyProvider to produce. Key length
    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."
3,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
4,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,The maximum number of arrays allowed for each array length.
5,dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc,1000,"Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client
    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"
6,dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms,3600000,"The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache
    between uses.  If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody
    uses it, it will be removed by a background thread."
7,yarn.resourcemanager.node-labels.provider.fetch-interval-ms,1800000,
8,mapreduce.jobhistory.move.interval-ms,180000,"Scan for history files to more from intermediate done dir to done
  dir at this frequency."
9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.connection.timeout.ms,20000,Connection timeout for probing dead node in milliseconds.
