2,dfs.client.key.provider.cache.expiry,864000000,DFS client security key cache expiration in milliseconds.
3,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."

8,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when

    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts."
