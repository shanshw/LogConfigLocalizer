0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
2,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.connect.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task spends in trying to connect to a remote node for getting map output."
3,dfs.namenode.ec.policies.max.cellsize,4194304,The maximum cell size of erasure coding policy. Default is 4MB.
4,yarn.nodemanager.node-labels.provider.fetch-interval-ms,600000,
5,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."
6,mapreduce.reduce.cpu.vcores,1,"The number of virtual cores to request from the scheduler for
  each reduce task."

    lock after the defined number of blocks have been processed."
9,dfs.datanode.balance.max.concurrent.moves,100,"Maximum number of threads for Datanode balancer pending moves.  This
    value is reconfigurable via the ""dfsadmin -reconfig"" command."
