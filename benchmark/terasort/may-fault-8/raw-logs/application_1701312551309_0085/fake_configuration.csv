0,io.bytes.per.checksum,467705751,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.delegation.key.update-interval,86400000,"The update interval for master key for delegation tokens 
       in the namenode in milliseconds."
2,mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize,10000000,"The maximum permissible size of the split metainfo file.
  The MapReduce ApplicationMaster won't attempt to read submitted split metainfo
  files bigger than this configured value.
  No limits if set to -1."
3,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries,0,"Expert only. Indicates the number of retries a failover IPC client
    will make to establish a server connection."
4,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
5,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,100,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Mover iteration."
9,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
