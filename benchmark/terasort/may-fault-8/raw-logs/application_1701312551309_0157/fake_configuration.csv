0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1706081678,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.timeline-service.generic-application-history.max-applications,10000,
2,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
3,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."

  operations.  If contact with the RM has occurred within this window then
  commits are allowed, otherwise the AM will not allow output commits until
  contact with the RM has been re-established."
6,dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,300,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."

    terminated."
9,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms,30000,"The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
