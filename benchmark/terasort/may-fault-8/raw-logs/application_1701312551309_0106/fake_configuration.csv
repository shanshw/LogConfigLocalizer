    record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever records(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
