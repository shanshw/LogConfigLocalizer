0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps,9,"Threshold for number of maps, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  Users may override this value,
  but only downward."
2,hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity,36000,"Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed."
3,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
4,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
5,seq.io.sort.factor,100,"The number of streams to merge at once while sorting
      files using SequenceFile.Sorter.
      This determines the number of open file handles."
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms,10000,Number of milliseconds to wait before the job client kills the application.
7,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.max.outstanding.paths,10000,"Defines the maximum number of paths to satisfy that can be queued up in the
    Satisfier call queue in a period of time. Default value is 10000."
8,dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,"The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume."
9,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."
