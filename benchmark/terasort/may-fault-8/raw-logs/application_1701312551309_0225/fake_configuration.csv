0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis,600000,The time for which retry cache entries are retained.
2,dfs.client.hedged.read.threadpool.size,0,"Support 'hedged' reads in DFSClient. To enable this feature, set the parameter
    to a positive number. The threadpool size is how many threads to dedicate
    to the running of these 'hedged', concurrent reads in your client."
3,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.disks,5,Minimum number of disks to run outlier detection.
4,net.topology.script.number.args,100,"The max number of args that the script configured with
    net.topology.script.file.name should be run with. Each arg is an
    IP address."
5,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
6,dfs.http.client.failover.max.attempts,15,"Specify the max number of failover attempts for WebHDFS client
    in case of network exception."
7,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
8,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,10000,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
9,dfs.namenode.blockreport.queue.size,1024,The queue size of BlockReportProcessingThread in BlockManager.
