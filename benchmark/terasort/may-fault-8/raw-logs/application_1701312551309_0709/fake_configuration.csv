,name,value,description
0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-2001296879,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
2,dfs.journalnode.sync.interval,120000,"Time interval, in milliseconds, between two Journal Node syncs.
    This configuration takes effect only if the journalnode sync is enabled
    by setting the configuration parameter dfs.journalnode.enable.sync to true."
3,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,2,Hard limit for the number of replication streams other than those with highest-priority.
4,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb,0,"The maximum size of the MRAppMaster attempt container logs in KB.
    0 disables the cap."
5,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive,100,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
6,dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds,3,"The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
7,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns,1000000,"The Secondary NameNode or CheckpointNode will create a checkpoint
  of the namespace every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns' transactions, regardless
  of whether 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' has expired."
8,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
9,dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval,5000,"The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs.
    The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose
    available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and
    enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value
    specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum."
