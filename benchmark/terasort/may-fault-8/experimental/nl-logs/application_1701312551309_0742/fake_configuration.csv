0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1287975694,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-reset-time-period-ms,10000,"The time period in milliseconds that the allocation count for each array length is
    reset to zero if there is no increment."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.max-weight,10485760,The maximum total weight of entries the cache may contain.
3,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
4,dfs.namenode.top.num.users,10,Number of top users returned by the top tool
5,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."

9,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms,30000,"When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache
    something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by
    sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode
    heartbeat.  This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will
    resend these commands."
