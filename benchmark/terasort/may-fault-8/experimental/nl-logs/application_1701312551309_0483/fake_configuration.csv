0,file.bytes-per-checksum,LoGvv,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  file.stream-buffer-size"
1,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."

3,fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,"Time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service; 0 means no timeout.
    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
    converged to Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds"
4,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
5,io.map.index.skip,0,"Number of index entries to skip between each entry.
  Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can
  facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory."
6,ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries,1,"The number of retries on connect error when establishing RPC proxy
    connection to NameNode, used for monitorHealth() calls."
7,hadoop.caller.context.max.size,128,"The maximum bytes a caller context string can have. If the
      passed caller context is longer than this maximum bytes, client will
      truncate it before sending to server. Note that the server may have a
      different maximum size, and will truncate the caller context to the
      maximum size it allows."
8,dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,52428800,"Maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers (instead of
        bootstrapping the standby namenode), in bytes per second.
        This can help keep normal namenode operations responsive during
        checkpointing.
        A default value is 50mb per second.
        The maximum bandwidth used for bootstrapping standby namenode is
        configured with dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
