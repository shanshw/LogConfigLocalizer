0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."
2,dfs.image.transfer.timeout,60000,"Socket timeout for the HttpURLConnection instance used in the image
        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle
        for this configured timeout, during image transfer."
3,dfs.namenode.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from clients.
  If dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is not configured then
  Namenode RPC server threads listen to requests from all nodes."
4,mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during merge before
   sending a progress notification to the MR ApplicationMaster."
5,yarn.timeline-service.writer.async.queue.capacity,100,
6,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
7,dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms,3600000,"The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache
    between uses.  If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody
    uses it, it will be removed by a background thread."
8,dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.interval,10,"The interval after which the skip levels will be formed in the skip list
    for storing directory snapshot diffs. By default, value is set to 10."
9,hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload.threads,3,"Only relevant if hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload is true.
    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."
