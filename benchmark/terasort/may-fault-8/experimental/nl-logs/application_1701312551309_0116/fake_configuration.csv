0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.image-tag-to-manifest-plugin.cache-refresh-interval-secs,60,
2,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."
3,dfs.namenode.service.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from DataNodes and from all other non-client nodes.
  dfs.namenode.service.handler.count will be valid only if
  dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is configured."
4,hadoop.registry.zk.connection.timeout.ms,15000,Zookeeper connection timeout in milliseconds
5,dfs.namenode.startup.delay.block.deletion.sec,0,"The delay in seconds at which we will pause the blocks deletion
    after Namenode startup. By default it's disabled.
    In the case a directory has large number of directories and files are
    deleted, suggested delay is one hour to give the administrator enough time
    to notice large number of pending deletion blocks and take corrective
    action."
6,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
7,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
8,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
9,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
