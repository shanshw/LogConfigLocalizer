0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1153457483,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
2,dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second,1048576,"If this is configured less than or equal to zero, the DataNode's block scanner will be disabled.  If this
        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume."
3,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."
4,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.interval.ms,60000,Interval time in milliseconds for probing dead node behavior.
5,dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms,3600000,"The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache
    between uses.  If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody
    uses it, it will be removed by a background thread."
6,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
7,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
8,dfs.namenode.top.window.num.buckets,10,Number of buckets in the rolling window implementation of nntop
9,hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.expiry,43200000,"Cache expiry time for a Key, after which the cache Queue for this
    key will be dropped. Default = 12hrs"
