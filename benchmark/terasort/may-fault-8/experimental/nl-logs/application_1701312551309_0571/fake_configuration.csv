0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1895087574,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."

    block lengths from the datanodes."

4,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."

6,dfs.namenode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the NameNode logs its metrics. The

    NameNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
7,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The

9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing dead node.
