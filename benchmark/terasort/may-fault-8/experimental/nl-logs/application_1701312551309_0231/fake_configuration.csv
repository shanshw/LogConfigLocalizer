0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
2,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
3,mapreduce.map.skip.maxrecords,0,"The number of acceptable skip records surrounding the bad
    record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever records(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
4,mapreduce.job.max.split.locations,15,"The max number of block locations to store for each split for
    locality calculation."
5,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the AM - before reconnecting
    to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries to be used during
    reconnecting to the RM and fetching Application Status."
6,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
7,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
