0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.listen.queue.size,128,The length of the shuffle server listen queue.
2,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
3,tfile.fs.input.buffer.size,262144,Buffer size used for FSDataInputStream in bytes.
4,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.before.failover,3,"This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations
    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts."
5,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
6,dfs.datanode.socket.write.timeout,480000,Timeout in ms for clients socket writes to DataNodes.
7,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,3,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
8,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
