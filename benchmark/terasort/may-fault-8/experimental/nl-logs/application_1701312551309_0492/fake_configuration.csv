2,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
3,dfs.namenode.replication.min,1,Minimal block replication.
4,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
5,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval,3,"Minimum number of missed heartbeats intervals for a datanode to
    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."

7,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
8,dfs.namenode.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to

    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
