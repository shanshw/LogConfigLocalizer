0,io.bytes.per.checksum,960512577,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report,5,"Number of nodes to include in JSON report. We will return nodes with
    the highest number of votes from peers."
2,dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.initial.delay.ms,3000,"When KeyProvider is configured, the time delayed until the first
    attempt to warm up edek cache on NN start up / become active."
3,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
4,dfs.block.access.token.lifetime,600,The lifetime of access tokens in minutes.
5,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.mb,1536,The amount of memory the MR AppMaster needs.
7,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
8,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.disks,5,Minimum number of disks to run outlier detection.
