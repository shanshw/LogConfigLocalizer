0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1216356860,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.client.max-cached-nodemanagers-proxies,0,
2,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
3,io.map.index.skip,0,"Number of index entries to skip between each entry.
  Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can
  facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory."
4,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
5,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
6,dfs.namenode.accesstime.precision,3600000,"The access time for HDFS file is precise upto this value. 
               The default value is 1 hour. Setting a value of 0 disables
               access times for HDFS."
7,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
8,dfs.webhdfs.ugi.expire.after.access,600000,"How long in milliseconds after the last access
      the cached UGI will expire. With 0, never expire."
9,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file,10000,"Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on
        write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can
        degrade performance."
