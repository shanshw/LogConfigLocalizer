0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries,0,"Expert only. Indicates the number of retries a failover IPC client
    will make to establish a server connection."
2,io.file.buffer.size,4096,"The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
3,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
4,fs.s3a.retry.limit,7,"Number of times to retry any repeatable S3 client request on failure,
    excluding throttling requests."
5,dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms,20000,"The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC
    tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes
    SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY.
    If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump."

7,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
