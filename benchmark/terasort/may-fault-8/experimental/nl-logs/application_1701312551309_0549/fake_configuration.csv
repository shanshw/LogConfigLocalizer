0,yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.limit.kb,PwGKZ,"Maximum size of the syslog.shuffle file in kilobytes
    (0 for no limit)."
1,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."
2,dfs.block.access.key.update.interval,600,Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.
3,dfs.namenode.file.close.num-committed-allowed,0,"Normally a file can only be closed with all its blocks are committed.
    When this value is set to a positive integer N, a file can be closed
    when N blocks are committed and the rest complete."
4,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.before.failover,3,"This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations
    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts."
5,dfs.blockreport.split.threshold,1000000,"If the number of blocks on the DataNode is below this
    threshold then it will send block reports for all Storage Directories
    in a single message.

    If the number of blocks exceeds this threshold then the DataNode will
    send block reports for each Storage Directory in separate messages.

    Set to zero to always split."
6,mapreduce.task.io.sort.factor,10,"The number of streams to merge at once while sorting
  files.  This determines the number of open file handles."
7,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."

9,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
