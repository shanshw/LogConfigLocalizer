1,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-reset-time-period-ms,10000,"The time period in milliseconds that the allocation count for each array length is
    reset to zero if there is no increment."
2,dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec,21600000,Determines block reporting interval in milliseconds.
3,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups,0,"Number of backup files for the ApplicationMaster logs when using
    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for the ApplicationMaster when both
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb and

4,mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker,3,"The number of task-failures on a node manager of a given job
               after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. It
               MUST be less than mapreduce.map.maxattempts and

  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware

  buffered during read and write operations."

9,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
