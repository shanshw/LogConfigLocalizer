0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period,60,"How often, the StandbyNode and ObserverNode should check if there are new
    edit log entries ready to be consumed. This is the minimum period between
    checking; exponential backoff will be applied if no edits are found and
    dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max is configured. By default, no
    backoff is applied.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
2,dfs.client.retry.max.attempts,10,Max retry attempts for DFSClient talking to namenodes.
3,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."

    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
6,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."

8,hadoop.fuse.timer.period,5,"The number of seconds between cache expiry checks in fuse_dfs. Lower values
    will result in fuse_dfs noticing changes to Kerberos ticket caches more
    quickly."

  if there is no task speculated in this round."
