0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1817056745,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,io.map.index.skip,0,"Number of index entries to skip between each entry.
  Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can
  facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory."
2,yarn.nodemanager.elastic-memory-control.timeout-sec,5,
3,dfs.datanode.handler.count,10,The number of server threads for the datanode.
4,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive,100,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
5,dfs.client.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for a write pipeline in DFSClient side.
    This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value,
    no buffer size will be set explicitly,
    thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."

7,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the RM/HS before

      the write pipeline if new datanodes can not be found to replace
      failed datanodes (could be due to network failure) in the write pipeline.
      If the number of the remaining datanodes in the write pipeline is greater
      than or equal to this property value, continue writing to the remaining nodes.
      Otherwise throw exception.

      If this is set to 0, an exception will be thrown, when a replacement
      can not be found.
