  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads,0,"Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero
  to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available
  processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to
  serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection."

3,hadoop.caller.context.max.size,128,"The maximum bytes a caller context string can have. If the
      passed caller context is longer than this maximum bytes, client will
      truncate it before sending to server. Note that the server may have a
      different maximum size, and will truncate the caller context to the
      maximum size it allows."

8,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
