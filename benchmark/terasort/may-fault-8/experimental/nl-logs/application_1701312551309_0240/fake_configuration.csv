0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1152874999,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,3,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
2,yarn.timeline-service.writer.flush-interval-seconds,60,
3,ipc.client.connection.maxidletime,10000,"The maximum time in msec after which a client will bring down the
               connection to the server."
4,mapreduce.jobhistory.move.interval-ms,180000,"Scan for history files to more from intermediate done dir to done
  dir at this frequency."
5,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
6,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
7,dfs.journalnode.edits.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where
      the DFS journal node stores the edits. The permissions can either be
      octal or symbolic."
8,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
