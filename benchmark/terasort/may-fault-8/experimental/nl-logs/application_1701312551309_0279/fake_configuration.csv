    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
