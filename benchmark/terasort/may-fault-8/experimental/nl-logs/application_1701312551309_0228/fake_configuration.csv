0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,20,Threshold in milliseconds below which a disk is definitely not slow.
2,mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads,0,"Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero
  to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available
  processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to
  serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection."
3,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

5,dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.errors,5,"During a block move from a source to destination disk, we might

      before we declare a move between 2 disks (or a step) has failed."
6,fs.getspaceused.jitterMillis,60000,fs space usage statistics refresh jitter in msec.
7,dfs.namenode.snapshotdiff.listing.limit,1000,"Limit the number of entries generated by getSnapshotDiffReportListing within
