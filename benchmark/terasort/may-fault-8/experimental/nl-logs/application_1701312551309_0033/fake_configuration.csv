0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-404609460,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
    speed of quota initialization also affects the namenode fail-over latency.
    If the size of name space is big, try increasing this to 16 or higher."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.ssl.file.buffer.size,65536,Buffer size for reading spills from file when using SSL.
3,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
4,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
5,ha.failover-controller.cli-check.rpc-timeout.ms,20000,"Timeout that the CLI (manual) FC waits for monitorHealth, getServiceState"
6,tfile.io.chunk.size,1048576,"Value chunk size in bytes. Default  to
    1MB. Values of the length less than the chunk size is
    guaranteed to have known value length in read time (See also
    TFile.Reader.Scanner.Entry.isValueLengthKnown())."
7,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."

9,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.cancel-timeout,60000,"The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the output
    committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed"
