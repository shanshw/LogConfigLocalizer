3,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
4,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
5,dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes,4194304,"While reading block files, if the Hadoop native libraries are available,
        the datanode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly
        page data into the operating system buffer cache ahead of the current
        reader's position. This can improve performance especially when
        disks are highly contended.

        This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current
        read position which the datanode will attempt to read ahead. This
        feature may be disabled by configuring this property to 0.

        If the native libraries are not available, this configuration has no
        effect."
6,file.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

8,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."
