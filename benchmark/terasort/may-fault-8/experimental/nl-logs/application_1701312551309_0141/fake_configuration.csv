0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,nfs.rtmax,1048576,"This is the maximum size in bytes of a READ request
    supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you
    also update the nfs mount's rsize(add rsize= # of bytes to the 
    mount directive)."
2,dfs.domain.socket.disable.interval.seconds,600,"The interval that a DataNode is disabled for future Short-Circuit Reads,
    after an error happens during a Short-Circuit Read. Setting this to 0 will
    not disable Short-Circuit Reads at all after errors happen. Negative values
    are invalid."

5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
6,dfs.block.access.key.update.interval,600,Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.
7,dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved,104857600,"The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory
    in bytes. The default is 100MB. Support multiple size unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
8,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
9,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
