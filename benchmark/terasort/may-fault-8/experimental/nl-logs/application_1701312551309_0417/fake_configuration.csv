1,dfs.namenode.snapshot.max.limit,65536,"Limits the maximum number of snapshots allowed per snapshottable
    directory.If the configuration is not set, the default limit

2,dfs.qjournal.parallel-read.num-threads,5,Number of threads per JN to be used for tailing edits.
3,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
4,hadoop.registry.zk.retry.ceiling.ms,60000,"Zookeeper retry limit in milliseconds, during
      exponential backoff.

      This places a limit even
      if the retry times and interval limit, combined
      with the backoff policy, result in a long retry
      period"

    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
