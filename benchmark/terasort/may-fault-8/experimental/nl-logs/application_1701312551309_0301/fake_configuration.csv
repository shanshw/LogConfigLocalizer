0,io.bytes.per.checksum,234032646,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."
2,datanode.https.port,50475,HTTPS port for DataNode.
3,dfs.client-write-packet-size,65536,Packet size for clients to write
4,yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size,1,
5,dfs.qjournal.write-txns.timeout.ms,20000,"Write timeout in milliseconds when writing to a quorum of remote
    journals."
6,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."
7,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
8,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
9,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms,500,"How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have
    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
