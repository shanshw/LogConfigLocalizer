    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    one iteration, for satisfy the policy. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer."

    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of

  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."
