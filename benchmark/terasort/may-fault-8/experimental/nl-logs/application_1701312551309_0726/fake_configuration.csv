0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.block.access.key.update.interval,600,Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.
2,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
3,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."
4,hadoop.http.cross-origin.max-age,1800,"The number of seconds a pre-flighted request can be cached
    for web services needing cross-origin (CORS) support."
5,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries-on-timeouts,3,"The number of client retries on socket timeouts to the AM - before
    reconnecting to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during
    reconnecting to the RM and fetching Application Status."
6,dfs.namenode.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from clients.
  If dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is not configured then
  Namenode RPC server threads listen to requests from all nodes."

9,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.period-ms,5000,"How frequently the decay factor should be applied to the
    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
