0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1687820511,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level,16,"Uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
    segments, each governed by its own write lock."
2,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime,604800000,"The maximum lifetime in milliseconds for which a delegation 
      token is valid."
3,yarn.resourcemanager.activities-manager.app-activities.ttl-ms,600000,
4,ipc.client.connect.max.retries,10,"Indicates the number of retries a client will make to establish
               a server connection."
5,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
6,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-no-speculate,1000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there is no task speculated in this round."
7,fs.du.interval,600000,File space usage statistics refresh interval in msec.
8,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
9,dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms,300000,"The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating
    a full block report lease.  This prevents a crashed DataNode from
    permanently using up a full block report lease."
