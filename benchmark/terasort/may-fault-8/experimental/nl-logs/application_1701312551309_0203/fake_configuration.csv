2,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattrs-per-inode,32,Maximum number of extended attributes per inode.
3,fs.s3a.connection.timeout,200000,Socket connection timeout in milliseconds.
4,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.retry.interval.ms,30000,"When the NameNode needs to uncache something that is cached, or cache
    something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by
    sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode
    heartbeat.  This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will
    resend these commands."
5,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."

8,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
