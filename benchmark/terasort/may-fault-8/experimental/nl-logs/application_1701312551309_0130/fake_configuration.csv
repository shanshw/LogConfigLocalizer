0,ipc.server.listen.queue.size,H0IeD,"Indicates the length of the listen queue for servers accepting
               client connections."
1,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
2,yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.num-retries,0,
3,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.disks,5,Minimum number of disks to run outlier detection.
4,dfs.namenode.decommission.blocks.per.interval,500000,"The approximate number of blocks to process per decommission
    or maintenance interval, as defined in dfs.namenode.decommission.interval."
5,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.threads,5,"Number of threads to use for refreshing LocatedBlocks of registered
      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing
      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."
6,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."

    committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed"

  should be around the square root of the number of nodes."
