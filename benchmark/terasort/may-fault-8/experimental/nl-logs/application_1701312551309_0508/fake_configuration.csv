0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-2113630338,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
2,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms,400,"The initial delay (unit is ms) for locateFollowingBlock,
    the delay time will increase exponentially(double) for each retry
    until dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms is reached,
    after that the delay for each retry will be
    dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms."
3,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when
      BlockConstructionStage is
      PIPELINE_SETUP_CREATE and clientName is empty.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
4,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file,10000,"Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on
        write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can
        degrade performance."
5,dfs.client.failover.max.attempts,15,"Expert only. The number of client failover attempts that should be
    made before the failover is considered failed."
6,dfs.balancer.max-size-to-move,10737418240,"Maximum number of bytes that can be moved by the balancer in a single
    thread."
7,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-threshold,128,"The count threshold for each array length so that a manager is created only after the
    allocation count exceeds the threshold. In other words, the particular array length
    is not managed until the allocation count exceeds the threshold."
8,dfs.namenode.max-num-blocks-to-log,1000,"Puts a limit on the number of blocks printed to the log by the Namenode
    after a block report."
9,nfs.wtmax,1048576,"This is the maximum size in bytes of a WRITE request
    supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you
    also update the nfs mount's wsize(add wsize= # of bytes to the 
    mount directive)."
