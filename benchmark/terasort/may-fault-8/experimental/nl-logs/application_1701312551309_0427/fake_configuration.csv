3,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
4,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.idle.sleep.ms,10000,The sleep time of DeadNodeDetector per iteration.
5,mapreduce.ifile.readahead.bytes,4194304,Configuration key to set the IFile readahead length in bytes.

    incremental block reports from the Datanode to the Namenode."
8,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."

    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."
