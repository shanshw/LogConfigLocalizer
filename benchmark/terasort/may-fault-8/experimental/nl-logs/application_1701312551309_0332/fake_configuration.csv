0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-142855465,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
2,dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold,1000000,"If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
3,dfs.qjournal.prepare-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during preparation phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
4,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."

    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."
7,mapreduce.jobhistory.joblist.cache.size,20000,Size of the job list cache
