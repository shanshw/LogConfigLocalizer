0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.retries,5,Number of retries to use when finding the next block during HDFS writes.
2,mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval,1000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
3,dfs.balancer.max-no-move-interval,60000,"If this specified amount of time has elapsed and no block has been moved
    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Balancer iteration."
4,dfs.datanode.data.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where
  the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or
  symbolic."
5,dfs.encrypt.data.transfer.cipher.key.bitlength,128,"The key bitlength negotiated by dfsclient and datanode for encryption.
    This value may be set to either 128, 192 or 256."
6,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
7,dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold,10737418240,"Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
8,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
9,dfs.namenode.lease-hard-limit-sec,1200,Determines the namenode automatic lease recovery interval in seconds.
