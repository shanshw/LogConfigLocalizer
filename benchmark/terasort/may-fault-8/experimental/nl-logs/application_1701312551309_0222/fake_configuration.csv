0,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,l91u7,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.expire-after-access-minutes,5,"The length of time after an entry is last accessed that it
    should be automatically removed."
2,dfs.datanode.data.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where
  the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or
  symbolic."
3,yarn.nodemanager.elastic-memory-control.timeout-sec,5,
4,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.read.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task waits for map output data to be available for reading after obtaining
  connection."
5,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.threads,8,"Number of threads used by the Datanode for background
    reconstruction work."
6,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
7,dfs.datanode.balance.max.concurrent.moves,100,"Maximum number of threads for Datanode balancer pending moves.  This
    value is reconfigurable via the ""dfsadmin -reconfig"" command."
8,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."
9,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
