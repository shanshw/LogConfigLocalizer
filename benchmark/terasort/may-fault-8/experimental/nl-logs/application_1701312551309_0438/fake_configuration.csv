0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,file.replication,1,Replication factor
2,fs.ftp.host.port,21,FTP filesystem connects to fs.ftp.host on this port
3,dfs.datanode.block.id.layout.upgrade.threads,6,"The number of threads to use when creating hard links from
    current to previous blocks during upgrade of a DataNode to block ID-based
    block layout (see HDFS-6482 for details on the layout)."
4,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
5,dfs.namenode.max-lock-hold-to-release-lease-ms,25,"During the release of lease a lock is hold that make any
    operations on the namenode stuck. In order to not block them during
    a too long duration we stop releasing lease after this max lock limit."
6,mapreduce.client.progressmonitor.pollinterval,1000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    reports status to the console and checks for job completion. You may want to set this
    to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."
