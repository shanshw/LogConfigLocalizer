0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."

2,dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold,10737418240,"Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
3,dfs.namenode.inotify.max.events.per.rpc,1000,"Maximum number of events that will be sent to an inotify client
    in a single RPC response. The default value attempts to amortize away
    the overhead for this RPC while avoiding huge memory requirements for the
    client and NameNode (1000 events should consume no more than 1 MB.)"
4,yarn.nodemanager.resource-monitor.interval-ms,3000,
5,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
6,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
7,dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.buffer.size,128,"Only used when enables asynchronous audit log. Sets the number of audit
    logs allowed in the event buffer before the calling thread is blocked
    (if dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.blocking is true) or until logs are
    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."

9,mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms,604800000,"Job history files older than this many milliseconds will
  be deleted when the history cleaner runs. Defaults to 604800000 (1 week)."
