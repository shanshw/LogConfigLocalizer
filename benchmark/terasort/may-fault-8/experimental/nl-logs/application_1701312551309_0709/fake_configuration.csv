0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-2001296879,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.retry-interval,2000,"The delay between getJob retries in ms for retries configured
  with yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries."
3,hadoop.security.key.default.bitlength,128,"The length (bits) of keys we want the KeyProvider to produce. Key length
    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."

5,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) a map reduce job is allowed to submit
    for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command line
    arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
6,dfs.datanode.block.id.layout.upgrade.threads,6,"The number of threads to use when creating hard links from
    current to previous blocks during upgrade of a DataNode to block ID-based
    block layout (see HDFS-6482 for details on the layout)."
7,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
8,fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks,4,"Maximum Number of blocks a single output stream can have
    active (uploading, or queued to the central FileSystem
    instance's pool of queued operations.

    This stops a single stream overloading the shared thread pool."
