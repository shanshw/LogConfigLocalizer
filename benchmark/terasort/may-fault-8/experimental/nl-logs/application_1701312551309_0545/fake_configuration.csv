  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap

  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
9,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,10000,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
