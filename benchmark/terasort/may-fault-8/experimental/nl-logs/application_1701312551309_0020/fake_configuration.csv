  during the copy(shuffle) phase."
1,dfs.datanode.handler.count,10,The number of server threads for the datanode.
2,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout.check-interval-ms,20000,"The interval in milliseconds between which the MR framework
  checks if task attempts stay in finishing state for too long."

5,mapreduce.jobhistory.jobname.limit,50,Number of characters allowed for job name in Job History Server web page.
6,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,

7,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
