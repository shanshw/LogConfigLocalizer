0,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,0.22931182,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
1,dfs.namenode.list.cache.directives.num.responses,100,"This value controls the number of cache directives that the NameNode will
    send over the wire in response to a listDirectives RPC."
2,dfs.namenode.reencrypt.edek.threads,10,"Maximum number of re-encrypt threads to contact the KMS
    and re-encrypt the edeks."
3,dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication,0,"The minimum number of replications that are needed to not to fail
      the write pipeline if new datanodes can not be found to replace
      failed datanodes (could be due to network failure) in the write pipeline.
      If the number of the remaining datanodes in the write pipeline is greater
      than or equal to this property value, continue writing to the remaining nodes.
      Otherwise throw exception.

      If this is set to 0, an exception will be thrown, when a replacement
      can not be found.

    for web services needing cross-origin (CORS) support."
6,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.connection.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the connection timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."

   sending a progress notification to the MR ApplicationMaster."
9,dfs.client.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,30000,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a dfsclient. By default, this parameter is set to 30000
    milliseconds (30 seconds)."
