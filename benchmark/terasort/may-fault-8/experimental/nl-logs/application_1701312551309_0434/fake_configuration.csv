0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-271342711,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."

    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."

4,dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds,3,"The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

  the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or
  symbolic."
