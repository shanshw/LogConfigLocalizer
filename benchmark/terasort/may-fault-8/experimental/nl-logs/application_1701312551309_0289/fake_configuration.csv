0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,fs.s3a.connection.establish.timeout,5000,Socket connection setup timeout in milliseconds.
2,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
3,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."

8,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) a map reduce job is allowed to submit
    for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command line
    arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
9,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
