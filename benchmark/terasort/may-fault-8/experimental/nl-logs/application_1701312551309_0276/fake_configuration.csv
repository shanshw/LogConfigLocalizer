      If the number of samples is below this then outlier detection is skipped."

        write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can

  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  Users may override this value,

7,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.max.outstanding.paths,10000,"Defines the maximum number of paths to satisfy that can be queued up in the
    Satisfier call queue in a period of time. Default value is 10000."
8,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
