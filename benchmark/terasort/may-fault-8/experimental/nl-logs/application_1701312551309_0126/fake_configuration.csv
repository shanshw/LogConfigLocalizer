3,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
4,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."
5,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."

        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume."

8,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
