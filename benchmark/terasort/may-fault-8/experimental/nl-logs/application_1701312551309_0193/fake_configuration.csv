0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1452768612,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
2,dfs.client.hedged.read.threshold.millis,500,"Configure 'hedged' reads in DFSClient. This is the number of milliseconds
    to wait before starting up a 'hedged' read."
3,mapreduce.job.counters.max,120,The max number of user counters allowed per job.
4,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
5,ipc.server.listen.queue.size,256,"Indicates the length of the listen queue for servers accepting
               client connections."
6,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
7,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk
    operations on the datanode. These threads consume I/O and CPU at the
    same time. This will affect normal data node operations."
8,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
9,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
