2,dfs.namenode.max-lock-hold-to-release-lease-ms,25,"During the release of lease a lock is hold that make any
    operations on the namenode stuck. In order to not block them during
    a too long duration we stop releasing lease after this max lock limit."

  every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.period' seconds to query the number
  of uncheckpointed transactions. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then
  seconds is assumed."
4,yarn.app.mapreduce.client-am.ipc.max-retries-on-timeouts,3,"The number of client retries on socket timeouts to the AM - before
    reconnecting to the RM to fetch Application Status.
    In other words, it is the ipc.client.connect.max.retries.on.timeouts to be used during

5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file,10000,"Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on

  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
