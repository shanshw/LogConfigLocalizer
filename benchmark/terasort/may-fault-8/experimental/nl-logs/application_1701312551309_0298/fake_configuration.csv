0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1787815325,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ha.health-monitor.connect-retry-interval.ms,1000,How often to retry connecting to the service.
2,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
3,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."
4,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."
5,yarn.timeline-service.timeline-client.number-of-async-entities-to-merge,10,
6,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
