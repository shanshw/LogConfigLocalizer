0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.domain.socket.disable.interval.seconds,600,"The interval that a DataNode is disabled for future Short-Circuit Reads,
    after an error happens during a Short-Circuit Read. Setting this to 0 will
    not disable Short-Circuit Reads at all after errors happen. Negative values
    are invalid."
2,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources,0,"The maximum number of resources a map reduce job is allowed to
    submit for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command
    line arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
3,dfs.namenode.read-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a read lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."

9,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
