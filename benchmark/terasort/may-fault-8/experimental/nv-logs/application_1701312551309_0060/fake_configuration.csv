2,mapreduce.map.skip.maxrecords,0,"The number of acceptable skip records surrounding the bad
    record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever records(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."

5,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
6,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."

8,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."
