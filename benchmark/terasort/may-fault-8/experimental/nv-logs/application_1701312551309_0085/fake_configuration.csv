0,io.bytes.per.checksum,467705751,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report,5,"Number of nodes to include in JSON report. We will return nodes with
    the highest number of votes from peers."
2,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
3,io.map.index.skip,0,"Number of index entries to skip between each entry.
  Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can
  facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory."
4,dfs.namenode.list.reencryption.status.num.responses,100,"When listing re-encryption status, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
5,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."

    (upload, commit, abort, delete...)"
7,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
8,yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups,0,"If yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups are greater than zero
    then a ContainerRollngLogAppender is used instead of ContainerLogAppender
