  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.balancer.getBlocks.min-block-size,10485760,"Minimum block threshold size in bytes to ignore when fetching a source's
    block list."
2,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.rpc.threads,20,The maximum number of threads to use for calling RPC call to recheck the liveness of dead node.
3,mapreduce.reduce.maxattempts,4,"Expert: The maximum number of attempts per reduce task.
  In other words, framework will try to execute a reduce task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
4,mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads,0,"Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero
  to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available
  processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to
  serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection."

  buffered during read and write operations."
