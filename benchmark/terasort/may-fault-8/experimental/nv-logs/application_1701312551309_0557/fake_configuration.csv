0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.ifile.readahead.bytes,4194304,Configuration key to set the IFile readahead length in bytes.
2,dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum,1,"dfs.namenode.edits.dir includes both required directories
    (specified by dfs.namenode.edits.dir.required) and optional directories.

    The number of usable optional directories must be greater than or equal
    to this property.  If the number of usable optional directories falls
    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."

4,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."

  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
9,dfs.namenode.safemode.extension,30000,"Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
