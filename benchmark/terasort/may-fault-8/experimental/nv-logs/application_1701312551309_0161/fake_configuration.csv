    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of

  default is 128"
3,dfs.blockreport.initialDelay,0,"Delay for first block report in seconds. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If

    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
