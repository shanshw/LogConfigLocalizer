0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms,10000,Number of milliseconds to wait before the job client kills the application.
2,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms,60000,The maximum delay (unit is ms) before retrying locateFollowingBlock.
3,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."
4,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive,100,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
5,nfs.rtmax,1048576,"This is the maximum size in bytes of a READ request
    supported by the NFS gateway. If you change this, make sure you
    also update the nfs mount's rsize(add rsize= # of bytes to the 
    mount directive)."
6,dfs.namenode.replication.min,1,Minimal block replication.
7,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
8,mapreduce.reduce.cpu.vcores,1,"The number of virtual cores to request from the scheduler for
  each reduce task."
9,dfs.datanode.data.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for transfering block when
      BlockConstructionStage is
      PIPELINE_SETUP_CREATE and clientName is empty.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
