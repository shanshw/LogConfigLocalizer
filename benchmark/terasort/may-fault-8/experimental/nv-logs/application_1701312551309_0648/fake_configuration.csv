    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."

  task spends in trying to connect to a remote node for getting map output."
6,mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads,0,"Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero
  to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available
  processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to
  serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection."

    block list."
8,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
