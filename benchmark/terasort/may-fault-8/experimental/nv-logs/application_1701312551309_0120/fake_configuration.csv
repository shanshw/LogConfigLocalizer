0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."

5,ipc.maximum.data.length,134217728,"This indicates the maximum IPC message length (bytes) that can be
    accepted by the server. Messages larger than this value are rejected by the
    immediately to avoid possible OOMs. This setting should rarely need to be
    changed."
6,dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum,1,"dfs.namenode.edits.dir includes both required directories
    (specified by dfs.namenode.edits.dir.required) and optional directories.

    The number of usable optional directories must be greater than or equal
    to this property.  If the number of usable optional directories falls
    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."
7,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
