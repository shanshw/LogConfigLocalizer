0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts,3,"This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations.
    If this limit is exceeded, LdapGroupsMapping will return an empty
    group list."
2,dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval,300000,"This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond."
3,dfs.qjournal.select-input-streams.timeout.ms,20000,Timeout in milliseconds for accepting streams from JournalManagers.
4,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.datanode.cache.refresh.interval.ms,300000,"How often to refresh the datanode storages cache in milliseconds. This cache
    keeps live datanode storage reports fetched from namenode. After elapsed time,
    it will again fetch latest datanodes from namenode.
    By default, this parameter is set to 5 minutes."
5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-directory-items,1048576,"Defines the maximum number of items that a directory may
      contain. Cannot set the property to a value less than 1 or more than
      6400000."
6,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout.check-interval-ms,20000,"The interval in milliseconds between which the MR framework
  checks if task attempts stay in finishing state for too long."
7,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
8,dfs.webhdfs.netty.low.watermark,32768,Low watermark configuration to Netty for Datanode WebHdfs.
9,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."
