0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1216356860,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
2,dfs.http.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Specify the upper bound of sleep time in milliseconds between
    retries or failovers for WebHDFS client."
3,yarn.nodemanager.node-attributes.resync-interval-ms,120000,
4,ipc.client.idlethreshold,4000,"Defines the threshold number of connections after which
               connections will be inspected for idleness."
5,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
6,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockshared,10,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds a shared (read) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
7,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
8,dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms,3600000,"The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated.

    By default this parameter is set to 1 hour.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

    block list."
