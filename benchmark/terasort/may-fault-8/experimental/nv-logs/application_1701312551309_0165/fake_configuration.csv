0,io.bytes.per.checksum,235618695,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.fuse.timer.period,5,"The number of seconds between cache expiry checks in fuse_dfs. Lower values
    will result in fuse_dfs noticing changes to Kerberos ticket caches more
    quickly."
2,fs.getspaceused.jitterMillis,60000,fs space usage statistics refresh jitter in msec.
3,dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.buffer.size,128,"Only used when enables asynchronous audit log. Sets the number of audit
    logs allowed in the event buffer before the calling thread is blocked
    (if dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.blocking is true) or until logs are
    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."
4,fs.s3a.socket.recv.buffer,8192,Socket receive buffer hint to amazon connector. Represented in bytes.
5,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
6,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
7,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
8,fs.s3a.retry.throttle.limit,20,Number of times to retry any throttled request.
9,hadoop.zk.num-retries,1000,Number of tries to connect to ZooKeeper.
