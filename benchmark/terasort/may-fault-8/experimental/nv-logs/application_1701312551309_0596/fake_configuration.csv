0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,fs.s3a.connection.timeout,200000,Socket connection timeout in milliseconds.
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.scheduler.heartbeat.interval-ms,1000,"The interval in ms at which the MR AppMaster should send
    heartbeats to the ResourceManager"
3,file.replication,1,Replication factor
4,yarn.sharedcache.admin.thread-count,1,
5,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
6,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
7,dfs.disk.balancer.max.disk.throughputInMBperSec,10,"Maximum disk bandwidth used by diskbalancer
      during read from a source disk. The unit is MB/sec."
8,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.interval.ms,60000,Interval time in milliseconds for probing dead node behavior.
