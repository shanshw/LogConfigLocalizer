0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1501145294,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,The maximum number of arrays allowed for each array length.
2,fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks,4,"Maximum Number of blocks a single output stream can have
    active (uploading, or queued to the central FileSystem
    instance's pool of queued operations.

    This stops a single stream overloading the shared thread pool."
3,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns,1000000,"The Secondary NameNode or CheckpointNode will create a checkpoint
  of the namespace every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns' transactions, regardless
  of whether 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' has expired."
4,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.cancel-timeout,60000,"The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the output
    committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed"
5,dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,20,Threshold in milliseconds below which a disk is definitely not slow.
6,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
7,ha.health-monitor.rpc-timeout.ms,45000,Timeout for the actual monitorHealth() calls.
8,dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved,104857600,"The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory
    in bytes. The default is 100MB. Support multiple size unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
9,fs.trash.interval,0,"Number of minutes after which the checkpoint
  gets deleted.  If zero, the trash feature is disabled.
  This option may be configured both on the server and the
  client. If trash is disabled server side then the client
  side configuration is checked. If trash is enabled on the
  server side then the value configured on the server is
  used and the client configuration value is ignored."
