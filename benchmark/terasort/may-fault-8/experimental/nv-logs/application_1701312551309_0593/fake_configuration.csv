1,ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,0,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  If ipc.client.ping is set to true and this rpc-timeout is greater than
  the value of ipc.ping.interval, the effective value of the rpc-timeout is
  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."

4,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,100,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

    threads or less than 1."
8,fs.trash.interval,0,"Number of minutes after which the checkpoint
  gets deleted.  If zero, the trash feature is disabled.
  This option may be configured both on the server and the
