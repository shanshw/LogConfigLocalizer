0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms,604800000,"Job history files older than this many milliseconds will
  be deleted when the history cleaner runs. Defaults to 604800000 (1 week)."
2,mapreduce.map.maxattempts,4,"Expert: The maximum number of attempts per map task.
  In other words, framework will try to execute a map task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
3,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
4,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
5,dfs.mover.max-no-move-interval,60000,"If this specified amount of time has elapsed and no block has been moved
    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Mover iteration."

  which will be scanned to find a job."

8,fs.trash.interval,0,"Number of minutes after which the checkpoint
  gets deleted.  If zero, the trash feature is disabled.
  This option may be configured both on the server and the
  client. If trash is disabled server side then the client
  side configuration is checked. If trash is enabled on the
  server side then the value configured on the server is
  used and the client configuration value is ignored."
