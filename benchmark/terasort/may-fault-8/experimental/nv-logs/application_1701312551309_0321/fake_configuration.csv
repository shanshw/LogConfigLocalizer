0,io.bytes.per.checksum,891744574,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.reduce.merge.inmem.threshold,1000,"The threshold, in terms of the number of files
  for the in-memory merge process. When we accumulate threshold number of files
  we initiate the in-memory merge and spill to disk. A value of 0 or less than
  0 indicates we want to DON'T have any threshold and instead depend only on
  the ramfs's memory consumption to trigger the merge."
2,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."
3,dfs.namenode.startup.delay.block.deletion.sec,0,"The delay in seconds at which we will pause the blocks deletion
    after Namenode startup. By default it's disabled.
    In the case a directory has large number of directories and files are
    deleted, suggested delay is one hour to give the administrator enough time
    to notice large number of pending deletion blocks and take corrective
    action."
4,yarn.dispatcher.cpu-monitor.samples-per-min,60,
5,hadoop.security.dns.log-slow-lookups.threshold.ms,1000,"If slow lookup logging is enabled, this threshold is used to decide if a
    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."
6,yarn.resourcemanager.application.max-tags,10,
7,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
8,dfs.qjournal.accept-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during accept phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
9,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk
    operations on the datanode. These threads consume I/O and CPU at the
    same time. This will affect normal data node operations."
