0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
