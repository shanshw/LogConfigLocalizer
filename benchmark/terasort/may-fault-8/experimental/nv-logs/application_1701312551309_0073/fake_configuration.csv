0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1344483239,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
2,dfs.namenode.list.encryption.zones.num.responses,100,"When listing encryption zones, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
3,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
4,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-reset-time-period-ms,10000,"The time period in milliseconds that the allocation count for each array length is
    reset to zero if there is no increment."
5,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
6,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
7,yarn.timeline-service.entity-group-fs-store.cleaner-interval-seconds,3600,
8,dfs.client.socketcache.expiryMsec,3000,Socket cache expiration for short-circuit reads in msec.
9,dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold,1000000,"If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
