    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Mover iteration."

    NameNode will issue at any given time.  This prevents the NameNode from
    being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler

        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
