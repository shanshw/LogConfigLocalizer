io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Exception.org.apache.hadoop.HadoopIllegalArgumentException: Invalid checksum type: userOpt=null, default=CRC32C:0, effective=null",The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is set to 0 which is causing the Invalid checksum type error. This configuration should be set to a value larger than 0 to avoid this error.
fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,"1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Exception.org.apache.hadoop.HadoopIllegalArgumentException: Invalid checksum type: userOpt=null, default=CRC32C:0, effective=null",The configuration 'fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout' is set to 0 which means no timeout. This could potentially cause issues if a request takes too long and does not timeout. It is recommended to set this to a reasonable value to avoid potential issues.
dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Exception.org.apache.hadoop.HadoopIllegalArgumentException: Invalid checksum type: userOpt=null, default=CRC32C:0, effective=null","The configuration 'dfs.client.socketcache.capacity' is set to 16. This configuration determines the socket cache capacity for short-circuit reads. If this value is set too low, it could potentially cause issues with the system's ability to perform short-circuit reads. It is recommended to review this configuration and adjust as necessary."
