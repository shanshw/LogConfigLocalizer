Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space","The value of mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads is set to 0, which means the default value of 2 times the number of available processors is used. This could potentially lead to a high number of threads and cause the Java heap space to run out of memory."
