name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:1626368326
relevant log:2-1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of io.bytes.per.checksum is too large, which may cause the Java heap space OutOfMemoryError. It should not be larger than io.file.buffer.size.

name:file.client-write-packet-size
value:65536
relevant log:2-1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of file.client-write-packet-size is relatively small, which may cause inefficient data writing and lead to memory overflow.
