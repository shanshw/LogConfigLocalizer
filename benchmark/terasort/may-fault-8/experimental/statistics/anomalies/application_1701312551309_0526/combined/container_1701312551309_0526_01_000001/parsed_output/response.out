name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:132683589
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of io.bytes.per.checksum is too large, which may cause the Java heap space OutOfMemoryError. It should not be larger than io.file.buffer.size.

name:yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.task.listener.thread-count
value:30
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The number of threads used to handle RPC calls in the MR AppMaster from remote tasks is too high, which may cause the Java heap space OutOfMemoryError.

name:dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size
value:1048576
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create time, is too large, which may cause the Java heap space OutOfMemoryError. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance.
