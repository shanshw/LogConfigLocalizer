0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1706081678,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.timeline-service.entity-group-fs-store.scan-interval-seconds,60,
2,dfs.default.chunk.view.size,32768,The number of bytes to view for a file on the browser.
3,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.idle.sleep.ms,10000,The sleep time of DeadNodeDetector per iteration.
4,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
5,yarn.nodemanager.log-aggregation.roll-monitoring-interval-seconds.min,3600,
6,dfs.client.socket-timeout,60000,Default timeout value in milliseconds for all sockets.
7,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk
    operations on the datanode. These threads consume I/O and CPU at the
    same time. This will affect normal data node operations."
8,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
9,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.retry-interval,2000,"The delay between getJob retries in ms for retries configured
  with yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries."
