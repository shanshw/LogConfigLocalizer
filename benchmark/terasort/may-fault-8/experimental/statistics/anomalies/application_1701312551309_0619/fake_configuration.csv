0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.default.chunk.view.size,32768,The number of bytes to view for a file on the browser.
2,dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec,21600000,Determines block reporting interval in milliseconds.
3,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
4,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.datanode.cache.refresh.interval.ms,300000,"How often to refresh the datanode storages cache in milliseconds. This cache
    keeps live datanode storage reports fetched from namenode. After elapsed time,
    it will again fetch latest datanodes from namenode.
    By default, this parameter is set to 5 minutes."
5,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.stripedread.timeout.millis,5000,Datanode striped read timeout in milliseconds.
6,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattrs-per-inode,32,Maximum number of extended attributes per inode.
7,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
8,hadoop.registry.zk.retry.ceiling.ms,60000,"Zookeeper retry limit in milliseconds, during
      exponential backoff.

      This places a limit even
      if the retry times and interval limit, combined
      with the backoff policy, result in a long retry
      period"
9,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
