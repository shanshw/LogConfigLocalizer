0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.attempts,0,"The number of times the submitter of the job wants to retry job
    end notification if it fails. This is capped by
    mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts"
2,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."

4,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.max-retries,3,"The number of client retries to the RM/HS before
    throwing exception. This is a layer above the ipc."

    from the movement needed queue."

7,ha.health-monitor.connect-retry-interval.ms,1000,How often to retry connecting to the service.
8,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
