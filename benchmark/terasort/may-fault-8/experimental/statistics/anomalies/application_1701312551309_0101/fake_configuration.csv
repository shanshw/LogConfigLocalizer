0,io.bytes.per.checksum,819562056,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.zk.retry-interval-ms,1000,Retry interval in milliseconds when connecting to ZooKeeper.
2,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,100,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
3,hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload.threads,3,"Only relevant if hadoop.security.groups.cache.background.reload is true.
    Controls the number of concurrent background user->group cache entry
    refreshes. Pending refresh requests beyond this value are queued and
    processed when a thread is free."
4,dfs.namenode.maintenance.replication.min,1,Minimal live block replication in existence of maintenance mode.
5,mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms,604800000,"Job history files older than this many milliseconds will
  be deleted when the history cleaner runs. Defaults to 604800000 (1 week)."
6,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
7,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
8,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.suspectnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing suspect node.
