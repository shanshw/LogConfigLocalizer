0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms,60000,The maximum delay (unit is ms) before retrying locateFollowingBlock.
2,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period,60,"How often, the StandbyNode and ObserverNode should check if there are new
    edit log entries ready to be consumed. This is the minimum period between
    checking; exponential backoff will be applied if no edits are found and
    dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max is configured. By default, no
    backoff is applied.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
3,dfs.mover.max-no-move-interval,60000,"If this specified amount of time has elapsed and no block has been moved
    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Mover iteration."
4,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
5,fs.s3a.retry.limit,7,"Number of times to retry any repeatable S3 client request on failure,
    excluding throttling requests."
6,ha.health-monitor.rpc-timeout.ms,45000,Timeout for the actual monitorHealth() calls.
7,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
8,dfs.ls.limit,1000,"Limit the number of files printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
9,dfs.namenode.service.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from DataNodes and from all other non-client nodes.
  dfs.namenode.service.handler.count will be valid only if
  dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is configured."
