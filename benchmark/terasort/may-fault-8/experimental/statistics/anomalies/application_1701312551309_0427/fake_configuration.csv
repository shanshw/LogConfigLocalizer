0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms,10000,Number of milliseconds to wait before the job client kills the application.
2,dfs.namenode.top.num.users,10,Number of top users returned by the top tool
3,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.millis,300000,"If any of file related block movements not at all reported by datanode,
    then after this timeout(in milliseconds), the item will be added back to movement needed list
    at namenode which will be retried for block movements.
    The default value is 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 mins)"

5,dfs.blockreport.split.threshold,1000000,"If the number of blocks on the DataNode is below this
    threshold then it will send block reports for all Storage Directories
    in a single message.

    If the number of blocks exceeds this threshold then the DataNode will
    send block reports for each Storage Directory in separate messages.

    Set to zero to always split."
6,dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels,0,"Maximum no of the skip levels to be maintained in the skip list for
    storing directory snapshot diffs. By default, it is set to 0 and a linear
    list will be used to store the directory snapshot diffs."
7,dfs.datanode.max.slowdisks.to.exclude,0,"The number of slow disks that needs to be excluded. By default, this parameter is set to 0,
    which disables excluding slow disk when choosing volume."
8,yarn.app.mapreduce.task.container.log.backups,0,"Number of backup files for task logs when using
    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for tasks when both mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb and

9,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume used to process async disk
    operations on the datanode. These threads consume I/O and CPU at the
    same time. This will affect normal data node operations."
