0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.renew-interval,86400000,The renewal interval for delegation token in milliseconds.
2,dfs.qjournal.parallel-read.num-threads,5,Number of threads per JN to be used for tailing edits.
3,yarn.nodemanager.localizer.fetch.thread-count,4,
4,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
5,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
6,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
7,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
8,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
9,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.nodes,10,Minimum number of nodes to run outlier detection.
