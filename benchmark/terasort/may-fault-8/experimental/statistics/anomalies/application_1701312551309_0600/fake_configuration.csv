  In other words, framework will try to execute a map task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
3,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to

      maximum size it allows."
