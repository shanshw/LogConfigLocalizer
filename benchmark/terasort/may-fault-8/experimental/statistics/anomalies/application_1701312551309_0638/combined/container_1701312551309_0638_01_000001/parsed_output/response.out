name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:1579384764
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation:The value of io.bytes.per.checksum is too large, which may cause the Java heap space to run out of memory. The value should not be larger than io.file.buffer.size.

name:dfs.client-write-packet-size
value:65536
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation:The dfs.client-write-packet-size might be too small, causing frequent disk I/O operations and thus leading to the OutOfMemoryError. Increasing the value might help to reduce the frequency of disk I/O operations.

value:50
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation:The number of threads for the delegation token renewer might be too high, which could lead to high memory usage and thus cause the OutOfMemoryError. Reducing the number of threads might help to reduce memory usage.
