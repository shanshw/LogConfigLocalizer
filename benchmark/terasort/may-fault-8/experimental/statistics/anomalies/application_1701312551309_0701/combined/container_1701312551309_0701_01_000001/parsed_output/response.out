name:mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps
value:132806309
relevant log:1-INFO	Not uberizing job_1701312551309_0701 because: not enabled; too much RAM;
explanation: The log indicates that the job is not being uberized due to not being enabled and having too much RAM. This could be related to the configuration option 'mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps' which sets a threshold for the number of maps, beyond which the job is considered too big for the ubertasking optimization. The value is quite high, which might be causing the issue.

value:60000
relevant log:1-INFO	Not uberizing job_1701312551309_0701 because: not enabled; too much RAM;
explanation: The log indicates that the job is not being uberized due to not being enabled and having too much RAM. This could be related to the configuration option 'yarn.nodemanager.container-log-monitor.interval-ms' which is missing a description. This could be causing the issue as the system might not be able to properly monitor the container logs.

name:dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps
value:20
relevant log:1-INFO	Not uberizing job_1701312551309_0701 because: not enabled; too much RAM;
explanation: The log indicates that the job is not being uberized due to not being enabled and having too much RAM. This could be related to the configuration option 'dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps' which sets the maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to a NameNode per second. The value is quite low, which might be causing the issue.
