0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-579686851,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.expire-after-access-minutes,5,"The length of time after an entry is last accessed that it
    should be automatically removed."
2,dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures,3,Maximum failures allowed when trying to get block information from a specific datanode.
3,dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,"The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache."
4,mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize,10000000,"The maximum permissible size of the split metainfo file.
  The MapReduce ApplicationMaster won't attempt to read submitted split metainfo
  files bigger than this configured value.
  No limits if set to -1."
5,ha.failover-controller.new-active.rpc-timeout.ms,60000,Timeout that the FC waits for the new active to become active
6,dfs.namenode.blocks.per.postponedblocks.rescan,10000,"Number of blocks to rescan for each iteration of
    postponedMisreplicatedBlocks."
7,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
8,dfs.namenode.list.encryption.zones.num.responses,100,"When listing encryption zones, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
9,dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms,300000,"The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating
    a full block report lease.  This prevents a crashed DataNode from
    permanently using up a full block report lease."
