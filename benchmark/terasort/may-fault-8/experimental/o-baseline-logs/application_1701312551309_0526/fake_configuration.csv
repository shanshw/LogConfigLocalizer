1,dfs.namenode.blockreport.max.lock.hold.time,4,The BlockReportProcessingThread max write lock hold time in ms.
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.task.listener.thread-count,30,"The number of threads used to handle RPC calls in the
    MR AppMaster from remote tasks"

4,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."
5,mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,"The interval (in milliseconds) between which the JobClient
    polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. You may want to
    set this to a lower value to make tests run faster on a single node system. Adjusting
    this value in production may lead to unwanted client-server traffic."

7,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-blocks-per-file,10000,"Maximum number of blocks per file, enforced by the Namenode on
        write. This prevents the creation of extremely large files which can
        degrade performance."
8,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."

    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
