0,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-speculate,l91u7,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there are tasks speculated in this round."
1,mapreduce.client.submit.file.replication,10,"The replication level for submitted job files.  This
  should be around the square root of the number of nodes."
2,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
3,yarn.client.nodemanager-client-async.thread-pool-max-size,500,
4,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
5,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."
6,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms,30000,"The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
7,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
8,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.image-tag-to-manifest-plugin.cache-refresh-interval-secs,60,
9,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.lockexclusive,100,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    processing phase which holds an exclusive (write) lock.
    This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
