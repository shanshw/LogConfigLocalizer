  io.file.buffer.size."

    connection to NameNode, used for monitorHealth() calls."

4,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."

    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."
7,hadoop.caller.context.signature.max.size,40,"The caller's signature (optional) is for offline validation. If the
      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."

      If the number of samples is below this then outlier detection is skipped."
