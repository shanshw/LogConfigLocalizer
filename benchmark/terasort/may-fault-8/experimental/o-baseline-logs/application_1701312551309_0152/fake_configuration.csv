    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."
2,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
3,dfs.client.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,30000,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a dfsclient. By default, this parameter is set to 30000
    milliseconds (30 seconds)."

    dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period) allowed by the Namenode to perform

8,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
9,dfs.datanode.lazywriter.interval.sec,60,Interval in seconds for Datanodes for lazy persist writes.
