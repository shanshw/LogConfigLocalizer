0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1060185601,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.listen.queue.size,128,The length of the shuffle server listen queue.
3,dfs.namenode.max.op.size,52428800,Maximum opcode size in bytes.
4,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
5,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,The maximum number of arrays allowed for each array length.
6,dfs.ls.limit,1000,"Limit the number of files printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
7,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.retries,5,Number of retries to use when finding the next block during HDFS writes.
8,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.cancel-timeout,60000,"The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the output
    committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed"
