    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
