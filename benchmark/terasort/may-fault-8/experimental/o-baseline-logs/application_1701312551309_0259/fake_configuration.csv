0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1243260439,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."

    in milliseconds."
2,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval,21600,"Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and
  reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.
  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed."
3,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
4,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."

    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
