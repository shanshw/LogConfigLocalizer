      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),

    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
