0,io.bytes.per.checksum,351615604,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting
  files, in megabytes.  By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which
  should minimize seeks."
2,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
3,fs.trash.interval,0,"Number of minutes after which the checkpoint
  gets deleted.  If zero, the trash feature is disabled.
  This option may be configured both on the server and the
  client. If trash is disabled server side then the client
  side configuration is checked. If trash is enabled on the
  server side then the value configured on the server is
  used and the client configuration value is ignored."
4,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms,30000,"The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
5,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period,3600,"The number of seconds between two periodic checkpoints.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
6,dfs.client.hedged.read.threshold.millis,500,"Configure 'hedged' reads in DFSClient. This is the number of milliseconds
    to wait before starting up a 'hedged' read."

8,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
9,ipc.server.purge.interval,15,"Define how often calls are cleaned up in the server.
    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
