0,dfs.client.read.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1382031381,Threshold in milliseconds for read entries during short-circuit local reads.
1,fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer,8192,Socket send buffer hint to amazon connector. Represented in bytes.
2,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
3,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
4,dfs.namenode.blocks.per.postponedblocks.rescan,10000,"Number of blocks to rescan for each iteration of
    postponedMisreplicatedBlocks."
5,nfs.server.port,2049,Specify the port number used by Hadoop NFS.
6,dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds,3,"The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
7,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
8,dfs.datanode.lazywriter.interval.sec,60,Interval in seconds for Datanodes for lazy persist writes.
9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.interval.ms,60000,Interval time in milliseconds for probing dead node behavior.
