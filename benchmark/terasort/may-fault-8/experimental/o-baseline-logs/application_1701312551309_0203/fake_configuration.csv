0,io.bytes.per.checksum,48362290,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups,0,"If yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups are greater than zero
    then a ContainerRollngLogAppender is used instead of ContainerLogAppender
    for syslog.shuffle. See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex"
2,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.read.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for reading.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
3,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,10000,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
4,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.parallelcopies,5,"The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce
  during the copy(shuffle) phase."
5,dfs.namenode.read-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a read lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."

    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."
9,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
    speed of quota initialization also affects the namenode fail-over latency.
    If the size of name space is big, try increasing this to 16 or higher."
