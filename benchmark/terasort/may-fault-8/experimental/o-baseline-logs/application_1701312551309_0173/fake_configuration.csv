0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.timeline-service.generic-application-history.max-applications,10000,
2,mapreduce.jobhistory.client.thread-count,10,The number of threads to handle client API requests
3,ipc.client.kill.max,10,Defines the maximum number of clients to disconnect in one go.
4,dfs.qjournal.http.open.timeout.ms,60000,"Timeout in milliseconds when open a new HTTP connection to remote
    journals."
5,ha.failover-controller.graceful-fence.rpc-timeout.ms,5000,Timeout that the FC waits for the old active to go to standby
6,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
7,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
8,dfs.namenode.ec.policies.max.cellsize,4194304,The maximum cell size of erasure coding policy. Default is 4MB.
9,dfs.datanode.max.slowdisks.to.exclude,0,"The number of slow disks that needs to be excluded. By default, this parameter is set to 0,
    which disables excluding slow disk when choosing volume."
