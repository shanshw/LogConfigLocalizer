0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for writing.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
2,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."

    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
5,dfs.namenode.block.deletion.increment,1000,"The number of block deletion increment.
      This setting will control the block increment deletion rate to
      ensure that other waiters on the lock can get in."

7,dfs.http.client.retry.max.attempts,10,"Specify the max number of retry attempts for WebHDFS client,
    if the difference between retried attempts and failovered attempts is
    larger than the max number of retry attempts, there will be no more
    retries."
