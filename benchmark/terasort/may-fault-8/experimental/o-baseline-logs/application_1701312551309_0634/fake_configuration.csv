        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume."

9,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
