3,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),

    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
