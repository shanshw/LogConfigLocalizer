name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:1178416143
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of io.bytes.per.checksum is too large, which may cause the Java heap space to run out of memory. The value should not be larger than io.file.buffer.size.

name:mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads
value:0
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads is set to 0, which means the default value of 2 times the number of available processors is used. This could potentially lead to a high number of threads and cause the Java heap space to run out of memory.

name:dfs.client-write-packet-size
value:65536
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The dfs.client-write-packet-size is set to a relatively small value. This could potentially lead to a large number of packets being created and cause the Java heap space to run out of memory.
