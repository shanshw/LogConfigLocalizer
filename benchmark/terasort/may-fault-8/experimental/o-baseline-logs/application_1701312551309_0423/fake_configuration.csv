        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle

4,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
