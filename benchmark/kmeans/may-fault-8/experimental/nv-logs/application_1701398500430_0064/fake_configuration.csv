0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1511251362,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.handler.count,10,The number of server threads for the datanode.
2,dfs.client.test.drop.namenode.response.number,0,"The number of Namenode responses dropped by DFSClient for each RPC call.  Used
    for testing the NN retry cache."
3,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.expiry.ms,300000,"This controls the minimum amount of time
    file descriptors need to sit in the client cache context
    before they can be closed for being inactive for too long."
4,io.map.index.skip,0,"Number of index entries to skip between each entry.
  Zero by default. Setting this to values larger than zero can
  facilitate opening large MapFiles using less memory."
5,yarn.sharedcache.nm.uploader.thread-count,20,
6,mapreduce.shuffle.connection-keep-alive.timeout,5,"The number of seconds a shuffle client attempts to retain
   http connection. Refer ""Keep-Alive: timeout="" header in
   Http specification"
7,ipc.client.connect.timeout,20000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for the
               socket to establish a server connection."
8,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.period-ms,5000,"How frequently the decay factor should be applied to the
    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
9,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
