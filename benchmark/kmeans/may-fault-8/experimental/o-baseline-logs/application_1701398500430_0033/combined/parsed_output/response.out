name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:0
relevant log:1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Exception.org.apache.hadoop.HadoopIllegalArgumentException: Invalid checksum type: userOpt=null, default=CRC32C:0, effective=null

name:dfs.client.failover.max.attempts
value:15
relevant log:1-ERROR	Task: attempt_1701398500430_0033_r_000000_0 - exited : org.apache.hadoop.HadoopIllegalArgumentException: Invalid checksum type: userOpt=null, default=CRC32C:0, effective=null
explanation:The configuration option 'dfs.client.failover.max.attempts' is set to 15, which might be too high and causing the system to retry failed operations too many times. Reducing this value might help in avoiding unnecessary retries.

name:hadoop.security.kms.client.timeout
value:60
relevant log:1-INFO	Service JobHistoryEventHandler failed in state STOPPEDjava.lang.NullPointerException
explanation:The configuration option 'hadoop.security.kms.client.timeout' is set to 60, which might be too low and causing the system to timeout before the operation is completed. Increasing this value might help in avoiding premature timeouts.
