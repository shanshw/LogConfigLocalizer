0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1339146750,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
2,mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting
  files, in megabytes.  By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which
  should minimize seeks."
3,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
4,dfs.qjournal.accept-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during accept phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
5,dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,"The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume."
6,ipc.server.listen.queue.size,256,"Indicates the length of the listen queue for servers accepting
               client connections."
7,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."
8,dfs.balancer.max-no-move-interval,60000,"If this specified amount of time has elapsed and no block has been moved
    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Balancer iteration."
