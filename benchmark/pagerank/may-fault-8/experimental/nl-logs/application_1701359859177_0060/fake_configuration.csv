0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.handler,1,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    HANDLER phase which do not involve holding a lock.
    See org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProcessingDetails.Timing for more details on
    this phase. This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
2,dfs.block.access.key.update.interval,600,Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.
3,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) a map reduce job is allowed to submit
    for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command line
    arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
4,ipc.[port_number].scheduler.priority.levels,4,"How many priority levels to use within the scheduler and call
    queue. This property applies to RpcScheduler and CallQueue."
5,dfs.namenode.storage.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where

6,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."

  reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.
  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed."

    current to previous blocks during upgrade of a DataNode to block ID-based
