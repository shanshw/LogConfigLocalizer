0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.journalnode.sync.interval,120000,"Time interval, in milliseconds, between two Journal Node syncs.
    This configuration takes effect only if the journalnode sync is enabled
    by setting the configuration parameter dfs.journalnode.enable.sync to true."

3,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."
