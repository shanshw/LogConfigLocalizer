  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception,5,"When the balancer is executed as a long-running service, it will retry upon encountering an exception. This
    configuration determines how many times it will retry before considering the exception to be fatal and quitting."
2,tfile.io.chunk.size,1048576,"Value chunk size in bytes. Default  to
    1MB. Values of the length less than the chunk size is
    guaranteed to have known value length in read time (See also

3,dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum,1,The minimum number of redundant NameNode storage volumes required.
4,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
