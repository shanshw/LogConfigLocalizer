2,fs.s3a.retry.limit,7,"Number of times to retry any repeatable S3 client request on failure,
    excluding throttling requests."
3,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."

      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
