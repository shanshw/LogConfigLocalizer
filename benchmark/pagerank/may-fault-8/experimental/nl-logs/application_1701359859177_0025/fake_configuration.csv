0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-196172510,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
2,dfs.client.mmap.retry.timeout.ms,300000,"The minimum amount of time that we will wait before retrying a failed mmap
    operation."

4,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."

6,hadoop.caller.context.max.size,128,"The maximum bytes a caller context string can have. If the
      passed caller context is longer than this maximum bytes, client will
      truncate it before sending to server. Note that the server may have a
      different maximum size, and will truncate the caller context to the
      maximum size it allows."
7,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.threads,1,"How many threads should the threadpool used to compile reports
  for volumes in parallel have."
8,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms,500,"How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have
    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
9,dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,300,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."
