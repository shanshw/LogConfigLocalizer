0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms,10000,Number of milliseconds to wait before the job client kills the application.
2,dfs.ha.zkfc.nn.http.timeout.ms,20000,"The HTTP connection and read timeout value (unit is ms ) when DFS ZKFC
    tries to get local NN thread dump after local NN becomes
    SERVICE_NOT_RESPONDING or SERVICE_UNHEALTHY.
    If it is set to zero, DFS ZKFC won't get local NN thread dump."
3,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups,0,"Number of backup files for the ApplicationMaster logs when using
    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for the ApplicationMaster when both
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups are greater than zero."

5,dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases,6,"The maximum number of leases for full block reports that the
    NameNode will issue at any given time.  This prevents the NameNode from
    being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler

    threads or less than 1."
6,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
7,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.metrics.top.user.count,10,"The number of top (i.e., heaviest) users to emit metric
    information about. This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
8,dfs.balancer.max-iteration-time,1200000,"Maximum amount of time while an iteration can be run by the Balancer. After
    this time the Balancer will stop the iteration, and reevaluate the work
    needs to be done to Balance the cluster. The default value is 20 minutes."
9,dfs.mover.movedWinWidth,5400000,"The minimum time interval, in milliseconds, that a block can be
