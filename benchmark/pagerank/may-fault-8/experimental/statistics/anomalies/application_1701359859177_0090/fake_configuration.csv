0,io.bytes.per.checksum,413957648,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanagers.heartbeat-interval-ms,1000,
2,dfs.namenode.blockreport.queue.size,1024,The queue size of BlockReportProcessingThread in BlockManager.
3,hadoop.caller.context.max.size,128,"The maximum bytes a caller context string can have. If the
      passed caller context is longer than this maximum bytes, client will
      truncate it before sending to server. Note that the server may have a
      different maximum size, and will truncate the caller context to the
      maximum size it allows."
4,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
5,dfs.namenode.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from clients.
  If dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is not configured then
  Namenode RPC server threads listen to requests from all nodes."
6,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
7,dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained,2,"The number of image checkpoint files (fsimage_*) that will be retained by
  the NameNode and Secondary NameNode in their storage directories. All edit
  logs (stored on edits_* files) necessary to recover an up-to-date namespace from the oldest retained
  checkpoint will also be retained."
8,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
9,dfs.replication.max,512,Maximal block replication.
