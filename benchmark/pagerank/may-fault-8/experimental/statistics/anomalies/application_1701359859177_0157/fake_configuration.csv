0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."

3,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."

6,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.connection.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the connection timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."
7,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
8,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.handler,1,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    HANDLER phase which do not involve holding a lock.
    See org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProcessingDetails.Timing for more details on
    this phase. This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
9,mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-no-speculate,1000,"The waiting time(ms) to do next round of speculation
  if there is no task speculated in this round."
