0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,10000,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
2,dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,300,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."
3,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
4,ftp.replication,3,Replication factor
5,dfs.qjournal.prepare-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during preparation phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
6,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused."
7,dfs.edit.log.transfer.timeout,30000,"Socket timeout for edit log transfer in milliseconds. This timeout
    should be configured such that normal edit log transfer for journal
    node syncing can complete successfully."
8,dfs.namenode.write-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a write lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
9,ipc.client.connect.retry.interval,1000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for
    before retrying to establish a server connection."
