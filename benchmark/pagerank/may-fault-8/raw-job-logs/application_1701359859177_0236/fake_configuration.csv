0,io.bytes.per.checksum,2019152374,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.image-tag-to-manifest-plugin.num-manifests-to-cache,10,
2,tfile.fs.input.buffer.size,262144,Buffer size used for FSDataInputStream in bytes.
3,mapreduce.job.max.split.locations,15,"The max number of block locations to store for each split for
    locality calculation."
4,hadoop.fuse.connection.timeout,300,"The minimum number of seconds that we'll cache libhdfs connection objects
    in fuse_dfs. Lower values will result in lower memory consumption; higher
    values may speed up access by avoiding the overhead of creating new
    connection objects."
5,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
