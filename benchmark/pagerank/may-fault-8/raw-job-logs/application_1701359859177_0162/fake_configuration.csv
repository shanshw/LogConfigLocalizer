0,mapreduce.reduce.cpu.vcores,-993979052,"The number of virtual cores to request from the scheduler for
  each reduce task."
1,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
2,hadoop.security.dns.log-slow-lookups.threshold.ms,1000,"If slow lookup logging is enabled, this threshold is used to decide if a
    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."
3,dfs.namenode.max-lock-hold-to-release-lease-ms,25,"During the release of lease a lock is hold that make any
    operations on the namenode stuck. In order to not block them during
    a too long duration we stop releasing lease after this max lock limit."

5,ipc.client.connect.retry.interval,1000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for
    before retrying to establish a server connection."
6,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
7,dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,300,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."
8,yarn.timeline-service.hbase.coprocessor.app-final-value-retention-milliseconds,259200000,
9,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,The number of virtual CPU cores the MR AppMaster needs.
