0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.min.outlier.detection.nodes,10,Minimum number of nodes to run outlier detection.
2,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."
3,dfs.balancer.service.retries.on.exception,5,"When the balancer is executed as a long-running service, it will retry upon encountering an exception. This
    configuration determines how many times it will retry before considering the exception to be fatal and quitting."
4,yarn.timeline-service.client.max-retries,30,
5,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
6,dfs.namenode.lease-hard-limit-sec,1200,Determines the namenode automatic lease recovery interval in seconds.
7,yarn.nodemanager.container.stderr.tail.bytes,4096,
