0,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.connect.timeout,YIDzB,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task spends in trying to connect to a remote node for getting map output."
1,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."

    incremental block reports from the Datanode to the Namenode."

    disk statistics. Set to an integer value between 1 and 100 to enable disk
