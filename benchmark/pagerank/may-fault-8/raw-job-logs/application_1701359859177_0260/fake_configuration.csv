0,io.bytes.per.checksum,690337647,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.split.metainfo.maxsize,10000000,"The maximum permissible size of the split metainfo file.
  The MapReduce ApplicationMaster won't attempt to read submitted split metainfo
  files bigger than this configured value.
  No limits if set to -1."
2,yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb,8192,
3,fs.s3a.executor.capacity,16,"The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."

5,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.group.hierarchy.levels,0,"The number of levels to go up the group hierarchy when determining
    which groups a user is part of. 0 Will represent checking just the
    group that the user belongs to.  Each additional level will raise the
    time it takes to execute a query by at most
    hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout.
    The default will usually be appropriate for all LDAP systems."
6,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps,9,"Threshold for number of maps, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  Users may override this value,
  but only downward."
7,mapreduce.job.speculative.minimum-allowed-tasks,10,"The minimum allowed tasks that
  can be speculatively re-executed at any time."
