    dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period) allowed by the Namenode to perform

    to be renewed."
5,dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second,1048576,"If this is configured less than or equal to zero, the DataNode's block scanner will be disabled.  If this
        is positive, this is the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's
        block scanner will try to scan from each volume."
6,dfs.ha.log-roll.period,120,"How often, in seconds, the StandbyNode should ask the active to
    roll edit logs. Since the StandbyNode only reads from finalized
    log segments, the StandbyNode will only be as up-to-date as how
    often the logs are rolled. Note that failover triggers a log roll
    so the StandbyNode will be up to date before it becomes active.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
7,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,10000,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
