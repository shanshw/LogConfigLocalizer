  task spends in trying to connect to a remote node for getting map output."

2,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
3,dfs.client.block.write.retries,3,"The number of retries for writing blocks to the data nodes, 
  before we signal failure to the application."
4,dfs.namenode.retrycache.expirytime.millis,600000,The time for which retry cache entries are retained.
5,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
6,dfs.qjournal.queued-edits.limit.mb,10,Queue size in MB for quorum journal edits.
7,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.expiry.ms,300000,"This controls the minimum amount of time
    file descriptors need to sit in the client cache context
    before they can be closed for being inactive for too long."
8,fs.s3a.max.total.tasks,32,"The number of operations which can be queued for execution.
  This is in addition to the number of active threads in fs.s3a.threads.max."
9,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."
