1,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups,0,"Number of backup files for the ApplicationMaster logs when using
    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for the ApplicationMaster when both
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups are greater than zero."
3,mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
4,mapreduce.job.maxtaskfailures.per.tracker,3,"The number of task-failures on a node manager of a given job
               after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. It
               MUST be less than mapreduce.map.maxattempts and
               mapreduce.reduce.maxattempts otherwise the failed task will
               never be tried on a different node."
5,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
6,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
7,dfs.balancer.dispatcherThreads,200,"Size of the thread pool for the HDFS balancer block mover.
    dispatchExecutor"
8,yarn.resourcemanager.delegation-token-renewer.thread-retry-max-attempts,10,
9,dfs.namenode.read-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a read lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."
