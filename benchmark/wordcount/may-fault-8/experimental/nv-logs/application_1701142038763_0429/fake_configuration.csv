0,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,-0.6634065,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
1,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
2,fs.s3a.retry.throttle.limit,20,Number of times to retry any throttled request.
3,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
4,dfs.namenode.max.objects,0,"The maximum number of files, directories and blocks
  dfs supports. A value of zero indicates no limit to the number
  of objects that dfs supports."
5,dfs.namenode.delegation.key.update-interval,86400000,"The update interval for master key for delegation tokens 
       in the namenode in milliseconds."
6,fs.s3a.threads.max,64,"The total number of threads available in the filesystem for data
    uploads *or any other queued filesystem operation*."
7,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
8,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
9,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused."
