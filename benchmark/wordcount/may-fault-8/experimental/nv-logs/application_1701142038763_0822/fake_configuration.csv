0,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,BPRGv,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
