0,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,-0.49524766,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
1,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."
2,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

5,dfs.balancer.max-iteration-time,1200000,"Maximum amount of time while an iteration can be run by the Balancer. After
    this time the Balancer will stop the iteration, and reevaluate the work
    needs to be done to Balance the cluster. The default value is 20 minutes."

      org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.blockmanagement.AvailableSpaceBlockPlacementPolicy.
      Special value between 0 and 20, inclusive. if the value is set beyond the scope,
      this value will be set as 5 by default, Increases tolerance of
      placing blocks on Datanodes with similar disk space used."
