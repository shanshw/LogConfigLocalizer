0,dfs.blocksize,0,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
1,mapreduce.jobhistory.move.thread-count,3,The number of threads used to move files.
2,dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.initial.delay.ms,3000,"When KeyProvider is configured, the time delayed until the first
    attempt to warm up edek cache on NN start up / become active."
3,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."

    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."
9,hadoop.fuse.timer.period,5,"The number of seconds between cache expiry checks in fuse_dfs. Lower values
    will result in fuse_dfs noticing changes to Kerberos ticket caches more
    quickly."
