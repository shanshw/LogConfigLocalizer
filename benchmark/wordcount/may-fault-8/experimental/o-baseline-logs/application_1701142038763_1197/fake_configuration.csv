1,dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby
      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize."
2,dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,"The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache."
3,file.replication,1,Replication factor
4,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."
5,dfs.ha.fencing.ssh.connect-timeout,30000,"SSH connection timeout, in milliseconds, to use with the builtin
    sshfence fencer."
6,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
7,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,100,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
8,yarn.nodemanager.delete.thread-count,4,
9,dfs.namenode.list.reencryption.status.num.responses,100,"When listing re-encryption status, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
