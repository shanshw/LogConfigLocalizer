name:dfs.client.hedged.read.threadpool.size
value:0
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: The value for the configuration option "dfs.client.hedged.read.threadpool.size" is set to 0. This means that no threads are dedicated to running 'hedged', concurrent reads in the client. This could potentially lead to performance issues.

name:yarn.cluster.max-application-priority
value:0
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: The value for the configuration option "yarn.cluster.max-application-priority" is set to 0. This means that all applications have the same priority, which could lead to resource allocation issues in a multi-tenant environment.
