name:hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs
value:BPRGv
relevant log:2-1-ERROR	Error starting MRAppMasterjava.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "BPRGv"
explanation:The configuration option 'hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs' is expected to be a numerical value representing the expiration time for entries in the negative user-to-group mapping caching. However, the current value is 'BPRGv', which is not a valid numerical value and has caused a NumberFormatException. This is the most likely root cause of the error.
