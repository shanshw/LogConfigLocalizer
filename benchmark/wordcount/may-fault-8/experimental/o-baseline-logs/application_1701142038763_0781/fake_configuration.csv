0,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,0.048086643,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."
1,yarn.sharedcache.client-server.thread-count,50,
2,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
3,dfs.namenode.decommission.interval,30,"Namenode periodicity in seconds to check if
    decommission or maintenance is complete. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
4,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.max-weight,10485760,The maximum total weight of entries the cache may contain.
5,yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.manifest.reload-ms,0,
6,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-single-resource-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) of a single resource a map reduce job
    is allow to submit for localization via files, libjars, archives, and
    jobjar command line arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to
    0 the limit is ignored."
7,yarn.resourcemanager.proxy.connection.timeout,60000,
8,httpfs.buffer.size,4096,The size buffer to be used when creating or opening httpfs filesystem IO stream.
9,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
