1,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,100,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

    NameNode will issue at any given time.  This prevents the NameNode from
    being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler
    threads.  This number should never be more than the number of RPC handler
    threads or less than 1."

    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter."
