0,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,3BYHD,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
1,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.expiry.ms,300000,"This controls the minimum amount of time
    file descriptors need to sit in the client cache context
    before they can be closed for being inactive for too long."
2,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."
3,yarn.sharedcache.store.in-memory.staleness-period-mins,10080,
4,dfs.http.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Specify the base amount of time in milliseconds upon which the
    exponentially increased sleep time between retries or failovers
    is calculated for WebHDFS client."
5,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.layer-mounts-interval-secs,600,
6,fs.s3a.threads.max,64,"The total number of threads available in the filesystem for data
    uploads *or any other queued filesystem operation*."
7,yarn.resourcemanager.reservation-system.planfollower.time-step,1000,
8,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."
9,dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds,3,"The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
