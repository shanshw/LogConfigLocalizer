0,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,qsbvK,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
1,dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved,104857600,"The amount of space to reserve/require for a NameNode storage directory
    in bytes. The default is 100MB. Support multiple size unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
2,yarn.nodemanager.collector-service.thread-count,5,
3,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
4,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
5,hadoop.fuse.timer.period,5,"The number of seconds between cache expiry checks in fuse_dfs. Lower values
    will result in fuse_dfs noticing changes to Kerberos ticket caches more
    quickly."
6,yarn.resourcemanager.client.thread-count,50,
7,dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms,300000,"The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating
    a full block report lease.  This prevents a crashed DataNode from
    permanently using up a full block report lease."
8,dfs.journalnode.sync.interval,120000,"Time interval, in milliseconds, between two Journal Node syncs.
    This configuration takes effect only if the journalnode sync is enabled
    by setting the configuration parameter dfs.journalnode.enable.sync to true."
9,dfs.namenode.list.cache.pools.num.responses,100,"This value controls the number of cache pools that the NameNode will
    send over the wire in response to a listPools RPC."
