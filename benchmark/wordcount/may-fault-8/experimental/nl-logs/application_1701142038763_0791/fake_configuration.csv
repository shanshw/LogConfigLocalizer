0,dfs.client.mmap.retry.timeout.ms,0,"The minimum amount of time that we will wait before retrying a failed mmap
    operation."
1,dfs.image.transfer.timeout,60000,"Socket timeout for the HttpURLConnection instance used in the image
        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle
        for this configured timeout, during image transfer."
2,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms,400,"The initial delay (unit is ms) for locateFollowingBlock,
    the delay time will increase exponentially(double) for each retry
    until dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms is reached,
    after that the delay for each retry will be
    dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms."
3,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
4,yarn.resourcemanager.delegation.token.renew-interval,86400000,
5,hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity,36000,"Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed."
6,mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections,0,"Max allowed connections for the shuffle.  Set to 0 (zero)
               to indicate no limit on the number of connections."
7,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."
8,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
9,fs.s3a.max.total.tasks,32,"The number of operations which can be queued for execution.
  This is in addition to the number of active threads in fs.s3a.threads.max."
