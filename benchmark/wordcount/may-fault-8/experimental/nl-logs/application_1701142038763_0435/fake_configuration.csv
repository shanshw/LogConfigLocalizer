0,mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records,0,"The number of records to process during merge before
   sending a progress notification to the MR ApplicationMaster."
1,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval,21600,"Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and
  reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.
  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed."
2,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
3,dfs.ls.limit,1000,"Limit the number of files printed by ls. If less or equal to
    zero, at most DFS_LIST_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be printed."
4,dfs.content-summary.sleep-microsec,500,"The length of time in microseconds to put the thread to sleep, between reaquiring the locks
    in content summary computation."

6,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."

8,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.threads,8,"Number of threads used by the Datanode for background
    reconstruction work."
9,mapreduce.am.max-attempts,2,"The maximum number of application attempts. It is a
  application-specific setting. It should not be larger than the global number
  set by resourcemanager. Otherwise, it will be override. The default number is
  set to 2, to allow at least one retry for AM."
