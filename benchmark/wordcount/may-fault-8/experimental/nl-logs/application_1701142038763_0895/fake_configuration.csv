0,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,-0.40649074,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
1,yarn.resourcemanager.proxy.connection.timeout,60000,
2,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
3,dfs.namenode.reconstruction.pending.timeout-sec,300,"Timeout in seconds for block reconstruction.  If this value is 0 or less,
    then it will default to 5 minutes."
4,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries,0,"Expert only. Indicates the number of retries a failover IPC client
    will make to establish a server connection."
5,mapreduce.job.reducer.unconditional-preempt.delay.sec,300,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers a forced reducer preemption irrespective of the
      anticipated headroom. By default, it is set to 5 mins. Setting it to 0
      leads to immediate reducer preemption. Setting to -1 disables this
      preemption altogether."
6,yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.sorting-nodes-interval-ms,1000,
7,mapreduce.job.counters.max,120,The max number of user counters allowed per job.
8,ipc.client.connect.timeout,20000,"Indicates the number of milliseconds a client will wait for the
               socket to establish a server connection."
9,dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms,300000,"How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log,
    in milliseconds."
