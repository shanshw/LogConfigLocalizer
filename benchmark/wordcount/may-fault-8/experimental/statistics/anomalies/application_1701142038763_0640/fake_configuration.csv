1,fs.s3a.threads.max,64,"The total number of threads available in the filesystem for data
    uploads *or any other queued filesystem operation*."
2,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."

5,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.millis,300000,"If any of file related block movements not at all reported by datanode,
    then after this timeout(in milliseconds), the item will be added back to movement needed list
    at namenode which will be retried for block movements.
    The default value is 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 mins)"
6,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
7,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
8,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
9,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-single-resource-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) of a single resource a map reduce job
    is allow to submit for localization via files, libjars, archives, and
    jobjar command line arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to
    0 the limit is ignored."
