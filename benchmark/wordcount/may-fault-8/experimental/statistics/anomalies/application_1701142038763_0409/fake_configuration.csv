1,mapreduce.job.reducer.unconditional-preempt.delay.sec,300,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers a forced reducer preemption irrespective of the
      anticipated headroom. By default, it is set to 5 mins. Setting it to 0
      leads to immediate reducer preemption. Setting to -1 disables this
      preemption altogether."

3,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.millis,300000,"If any of file related block movements not at all reported by datanode,
    then after this timeout(in milliseconds), the item will be added back to movement needed list
    at namenode which will be retried for block movements.
    The default value is 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 mins)"
4,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,

    By default it selects a random port available in runtime."

      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
