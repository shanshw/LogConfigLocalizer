2,dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval,5000,"The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs.
    The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose
    available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and
    enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value
    specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum."
3,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."

  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
