0,io.bytes.per.checksum,2034001868,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
2,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
3,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.fetch.retry.timeout-ms,30000,"Timeout value for fetcher to retry to fetch again when some
  non-fatal failure happens because of some events like NM restart."
4,dfs.namenode.maintenance.replication.min,1,Minimal live block replication in existence of maintenance mode.
5,dfs.namenode.edekcacheloader.initial.delay.ms,3000,"When KeyProvider is configured, the time delayed until the first
    attempt to warm up edek cache on NN start up / become active."
6,dfs.namenode.ec.policies.max.cellsize,4194304,The maximum cell size of erasure coding policy. Default is 4MB.
7,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
