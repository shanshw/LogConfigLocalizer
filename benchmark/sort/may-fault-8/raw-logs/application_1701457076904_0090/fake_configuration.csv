0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-209137009,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
2,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
3,yarn.nodemanager.elastic-memory-control.timeout-sec,5,
4,dfs.client.block.write.retries,3,"The number of retries for writing blocks to the data nodes, 
  before we signal failure to the application."
5,fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer,8192,Socket send buffer hint to amazon connector. Represented in bytes.
6,dfs.client.read.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,Threshold in milliseconds for read entries during short-circuit local reads.
7,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
8,fs.ftp.timeout,0,FTP filesystem's timeout in seconds.
9,mapreduce.shuffle.max.threads,0,"Max allowed threads for serving shuffle connections. Set to zero
  to indicate the default of 2 times the number of available
  processors (as reported by Runtime.availableProcessors()). Netty is used to
  serve requests, so a thread is not needed for each connection."
