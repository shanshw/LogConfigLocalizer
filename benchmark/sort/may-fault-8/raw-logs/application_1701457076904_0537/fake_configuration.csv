0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1985015058,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.refresh.read-block-locations.threads,5,"Number of threads to use for refreshing LocatedBlocks of registered
      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing
      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.cpu-vcores,1,The number of virtual CPU cores the MR AppMaster needs.
3,dfs.namenode.decommission.interval,30,"Namenode periodicity in seconds to check if
    decommission or maintenance is complete. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
4,yarn.sharedcache.nm.uploader.replication.factor,10,
5,net.topology.script.number.args,100,"The max number of args that the script configured with
    net.topology.script.file.name should be run with. Each arg is an
    IP address."
6,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."
7,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.scheduler.heartbeat.interval-ms,1000,"The interval in ms at which the MR AppMaster should send
    heartbeats to the ResourceManager"
8,dfs.balancer.max-no-move-interval,60000,"If this specified amount of time has elapsed and no block has been moved
    out of a source DataNode, on more effort will be made to move blocks out of
    this DataNode in the current Balancer iteration."
9,dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.buffer.size,128,"Only used when enables asynchronous audit log. Sets the number of audit
    logs allowed in the event buffer before the calling thread is blocked
    (if dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.blocking is true) or until logs are
    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."
