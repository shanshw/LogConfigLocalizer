0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1235908528,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout,60000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it stays in finishing state for too long.
  After a task attempt completes from TaskUmbilicalProtocol's point of view,
  it will be transitioned to finishing state. That will give a chance for the
  task to exit by itself."
2,dfs.image.parallel.target.sections,12,"Controls the number of sub-sections that will be written to
        fsimage for each section. This should be larger than
        dfs.image.parallel.threads, otherwise all threads will not be
        used when loading. Ideally, have at least twice the number
        of target sections as threads, so each thread must load more
        than one section to avoid one long running section affecting
        the load time."

6,hadoop.caller.context.max.size,128,"The maximum bytes a caller context string can have. If the
      passed caller context is longer than this maximum bytes, client will
      truncate it before sending to server. Note that the server may have a
      different maximum size, and will truncate the caller context to the
      maximum size it allows."
7,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."
8,dfs.namenode.safemode.extension,30000,"Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
