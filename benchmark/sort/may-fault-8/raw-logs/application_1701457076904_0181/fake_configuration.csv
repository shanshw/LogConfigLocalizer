0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-877495085,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.resource.check.interval,5000,"The interval in milliseconds at which the NameNode resource checker runs.
    The checker calculates the number of the NameNode storage volumes whose
    available spaces are more than dfs.namenode.resource.du.reserved, and
    enters safemode if the number becomes lower than the minimum value
    specified by dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum."
2,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.read.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task waits for map output data to be available for reading after obtaining
  connection."
3,fs.df.interval,60000,Disk usage statistics refresh interval in msec.
4,mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data-key-size-bits,128,Mapreduce encrypt data key size default is 128
5,dfs.datanode.http.internal-proxy.port,0,"The datanode's internal web proxy port.
    By default it selects a random port available in runtime."
6,dfs.domain.socket.disable.interval.seconds,600,"The interval that a DataNode is disabled for future Short-Circuit Reads,
    after an error happens during a Short-Circuit Read. Setting this to 0 will
    not disable Short-Circuit Reads at all after errors happen. Negative values
    are invalid."
7,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."
8,mapreduce.reduce.maxattempts,4,"Expert: The maximum number of attempts per reduce task.
  In other words, framework will try to execute a reduce task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
9,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."
