0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.reducer.unconditional-preempt.delay.sec,300,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers a forced reducer preemption irrespective of the
      anticipated headroom. By default, it is set to 5 mins. Setting it to 0
      leads to immediate reducer preemption. Setting to -1 disables this
      preemption altogether."
2,dfs.namenode.top.num.users,10,Number of top users returned by the top tool
3,dfs.client.mmap.retry.timeout.ms,300000,"The minimum amount of time that we will wait before retrying a failed mmap
    operation."
4,yarn.nodemanager.health-checker.timeout-ms,1200000,
5,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
6,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
7,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.period-ms,5000,"How frequently the decay factor should be applied to the
    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
8,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
9,dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval,300000,"This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond."
