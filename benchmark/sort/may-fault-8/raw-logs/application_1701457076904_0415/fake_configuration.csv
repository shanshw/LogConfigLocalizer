1,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,2,Hard limit for the number of replication streams other than those with highest-priority.
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.commit-window,10000,"Defines a time window in milliseconds for output commit
  operations.  If contact with the RM has occurred within this window then
  commits are allowed, otherwise the AM will not allow output commits until
  contact with the RM has been re-established."
3,dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum,1,"dfs.namenode.edits.dir includes both required directories
    (specified by dfs.namenode.edits.dir.required) and optional directories.

    The number of usable optional directories must be greater than or equal
    to this property.  If the number of usable optional directories falls
    below dfs.namenode.edits.dir.minimum, HDFS will issue an error.

    This property defaults to 1."

  non-fatal failure happens because of some events like NM restart."

    listing call. printed by ls. If less or equal to

8,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
