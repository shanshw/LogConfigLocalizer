0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.readahead.bytes,4194304,"While reading block files, if the Hadoop native libraries are available,
        the datanode can use the posix_fadvise system call to explicitly
        page data into the operating system buffer cache ahead of the current
        reader's position. This can improve performance especially when
        disks are highly contended.

        This configuration specifies the number of bytes ahead of the current
        read position which the datanode will attempt to read ahead. This
        feature may be disabled by configuring this property to 0.

        If the native libraries are not available, this configuration has no
        effect."

    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."
