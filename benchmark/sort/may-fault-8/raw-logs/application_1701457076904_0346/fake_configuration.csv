3,dfs.namenode.decommission.backoff.monitor.pending.blocks.per.lock,1000,"When loading blocks into the replication queue, release the namenode write
    lock after the defined number of blocks have been processed."
4,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
5,mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size,5,"Size of the loaded job cache.  This property is ignored if
  the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size is set to a
  positive value."
6,tfile.fs.input.buffer.size,262144,Buffer size used for FSDataInputStream in bytes.
7,dfs.webhdfs.netty.low.watermark,32768,Low watermark configuration to Netty for Datanode WebHdfs.
8,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
9,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
