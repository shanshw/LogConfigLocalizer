0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-483489136,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.slow.io.warning.threshold.ms,300,"The threshold in milliseconds at which we will log a slow
    io warning in a datanode. By default, this parameter is set to 300
    milliseconds."
2,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.read.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task waits for map output data to be available for reading after obtaining
  connection."
3,dfs.namenode.replication.min,1,Minimal block replication.
4,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
5,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."

7,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
8,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
