1,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."
2,dfs.namenode.write-lock-reporting-threshold-ms,5000,"When a write lock is held on the namenode for a long time,
    this will be logged as the lock is released. This sets how long the
    lock must be held for logging to occur."

4,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."

6,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described

9,dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration,2,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer."
