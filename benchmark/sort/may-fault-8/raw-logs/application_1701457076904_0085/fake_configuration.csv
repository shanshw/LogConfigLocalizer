0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1544648436,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
2,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."

6,dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold,1000000,"If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
