2,fs.s3a.connection.timeout,200000,Socket connection timeout in milliseconds.
3,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."

7,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.work.multiplier.per.iteration,1,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    one iteration, for satisfy the policy. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer."

  files.  This determines the number of open file handles."
9,nfs.mountd.port,4242,Specify the port number used by Hadoop mount daemon.
