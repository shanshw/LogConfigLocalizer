1,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruction.threads,8,"Number of threads used by the Datanode for background
    reconstruction work."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections,0,"Max allowed connections for the shuffle.  Set to 0 (zero)
               to indicate no limit on the number of connections."
3,dfs.replication.max,512,Maximal block replication.
4,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval,21600,"Interval in seconds for Datanode to scan data directories and
  reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk.
  Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
  in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
  is assumed."
5,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
6,yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb,1024,
7,file.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
8,yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.interval-ms,120000,
9,dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct,0,"Reserved space in percentage. Read dfs.datanode.du.reserved.calculator to see
    when this takes effect. The actual number of bytes reserved will be calculated by using the
    total capacity of the data directory in question. Specific storage type based reservation
    is also supported. The property can be followed with corresponding storage types
    ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
    For example, reserved percentage space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
    'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
    then dfs.datanode.du.reserved.pct will be used."
