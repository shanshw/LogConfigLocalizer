0,hadoop.security.dns.log-slow-lookups.threshold.ms,0.7357608,"If slow lookup logging is enabled, this threshold is used to decide if a
    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."
1,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing dead node.
2,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level,16,"Uses the concurrency level to create a fixed number of hashtable
    segments, each governed by its own write lock."
3,dfs.datanode.lock-reporting-threshold-ms,300,"When thread waits to obtain a lock, or a thread holds a lock for
    more than the threshold, a log message will be written. Note that
    dfs.lock.suppress.warning.interval ensures a single log message is
    emitted per interval for waiting threads and a single message for holding
    threads to avoid excessive logging."
4,yarn.scheduler.configuration.store.max-logs,1000,
5,mapreduce.shuffle.listen.queue.size,128,The length of the shuffle server listen queue.

8,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
9,dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,"Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent."
