0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1127025069,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
2,dfs.client.short.circuit.num,1,"Number of short-circuit caches. This setting should
    be in the range 1 - 5. Lower values will result in lower CPU consumption; higher
    values may speed up massive parallel reading files."

6,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
