,name,value,description
0,io.bytes.per.checksum,525038800,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.server.purge.interval,15,"Define how often calls are cleaned up in the server.
    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
2,dfs.client.socket-timeout,60000,Default timeout value in milliseconds for all sockets.
3,dfs.namenode.quota.init-threads,12,"The number of concurrent threads to be used in quota initialization. The
    speed of quota initialization also affects the namenode fail-over latency.
    If the size of name space is big, try increasing this to 16 or higher."
4,mapreduce.jobhistory.client.thread-count,10,The number of threads to handle client API requests
5,fs.s3a.executor.capacity,16,"The maximum number of submitted tasks which is a single
    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."
6,dfs.namenode.full.block.report.lease.length.ms,300000,"The number of milliseconds that the NameNode will wait before invalidating
    a full block report lease.  This prevents a crashed DataNode from
    permanently using up a full block report lease."
7,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
8,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
9,dfs.bytes-per-checksum,512,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  dfs.stream-buffer-size"
