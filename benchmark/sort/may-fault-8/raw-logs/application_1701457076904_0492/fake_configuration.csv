2,mapreduce.job.reducer.unconditional-preempt.delay.sec,300,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers a forced reducer preemption irrespective of the
      anticipated headroom. By default, it is set to 5 mins. Setting it to 0
      leads to immediate reducer preemption. Setting to -1 disables this
      preemption altogether."
