7,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.deadnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing dead node.
8,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."
