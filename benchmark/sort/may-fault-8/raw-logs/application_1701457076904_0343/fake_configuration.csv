2,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."
3,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."

5,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."

7,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
