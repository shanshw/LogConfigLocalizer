0,io.bytes.per.checksum,367197274,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
2,yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.delete-timeout-ms,1000,
3,fs.s3a.committer.threads,8,"Number of threads in committers for parallel operations on files
    (upload, commit, abort, delete...)"
4,yarn.timeline-service.client.retry-interval-ms,1000,
5,dfs.blockreport.incremental.intervalMsec,0,"If set to a positive integer, the value in ms to wait between sending
    incremental block reports from the Datanode to the Namenode."
6,dfs.datanode.data.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for writing block or pipeline
      recovery when
      BlockConstructionStage is PIPELINE_SETUP_APPEND_RECOVERY or PIPELINE_SETUP_STREAMING_RECOVERY.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
7,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
8,ipc.client.idlethreshold,4000,"Defines the threshold number of connections after which
               connections will be inspected for idleness."
9,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime,604800000,"The maximum lifetime in milliseconds for which a delegation 
      token is valid."
