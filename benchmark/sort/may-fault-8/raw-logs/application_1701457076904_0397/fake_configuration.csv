    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter."
