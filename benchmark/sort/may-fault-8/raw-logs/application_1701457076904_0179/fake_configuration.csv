0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
2,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size,10,"The initial size of thread pool to launch containers in the
    app master."
3,yarn.resourcemanager.opportunistic-container-allocation.nodes-used,10,
4,dfs.namenode.decommission.backoff.monitor.pending.limit,10000,"When the Backoff monitor is enabled, determines the maximum number of blocks
    related to decommission and maintenance operations that can be loaded
    into the replication queue at any given time. Every
    dfs.namenode.decommission.interval seconds, the list is checked to see if
    the blocks have become fully replicated and then further blocks are added
    to reach the limit defined in this parameter."
5,dfs.datanode.restart.replica.expiration,50,"During shutdown for restart, the amount of time in seconds budgeted for
    datanode restart."
6,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."
7,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."
8,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."
9,dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained,10000,"The maximum number of extra edit log segments which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart. When used in conjunction with
  dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained, this configuration property serves to cap
  the number of extra edits files to a reasonable value."
