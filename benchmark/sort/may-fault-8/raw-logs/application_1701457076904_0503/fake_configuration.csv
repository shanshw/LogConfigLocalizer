0,dfs.blocksize,0,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
1,dfs.image.transfer.timeout,60000,"Socket timeout for the HttpURLConnection instance used in the image
        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle
        for this configured timeout, during image transfer."
2,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.rpc.threads,20,The maximum number of threads to use for calling RPC call to recheck the liveness of dead node.
3,dfs.balancer.max-size-to-move,10737418240,"Maximum number of bytes that can be moved by the balancer in a single
    thread."
4,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
5,yarn.nodemanager.container-manager.thread-count,20,
6,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
7,nfs.server.port,2049,Specify the port number used by Hadoop NFS.
8,yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.timeline-server-v1.batch-size,1000,
9,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
