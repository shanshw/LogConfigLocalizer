0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.balancer.block-move.timeout,0,"Maximum amount of time in milliseconds for a block to move. If this is set
    greater than 0, Balancer will stop waiting for a block move completion
    after this time. In typical clusters, a 3 to 5 minute timeout is reasonable.
    If timeout happens to a large proportion of block moves, this needs to be
    increased. It could also be that too much work is dispatched and many nodes
    are constantly exceeding the bandwidth limit as a result. In that case,
    other balancer parameters might need to be adjusted.
    It is disabled (0) by default."
2,mapreduce.reduce.skip.maxgroups,0,"The number of acceptable skip groups surrounding the bad
    group PER bad group in reducer. The number includes the bad group as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad groups off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever groups(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
3,dfs.datanode.http.internal-proxy.port,0,"The datanode's internal web proxy port.
    By default it selects a random port available in runtime."
4,dfs.datanode.bp-ready.timeout,20,"The maximum wait time for datanode to be ready before failing the
    received request. Setting this to 0 fails requests right away if the
    datanode is not yet registered with the namenode. This wait time
    reduces initial request failures after datanode restart.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
6,dfs.namenode.max.objects,0,"The maximum number of files, directories and blocks
  dfs supports. A value of zero indicates no limit to the number
  of objects that dfs supports."
7,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.hdfs-manifest-to-resources-plugin.stat-cache-timeout-interval-secs,360,
8,ipc.client.connection.maxidletime,10000,"The maximum time in msec after which a client will bring down the
               connection to the server."
9,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.suspectnode.interval.ms,300,Interval time in milliseconds for probing suspect node behavior.
