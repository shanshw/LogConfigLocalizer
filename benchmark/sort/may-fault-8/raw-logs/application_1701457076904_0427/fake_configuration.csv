0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.min-block-size,1048576,"Minimum block size in bytes, enforced by the Namenode at create
      time. This prevents the accidental creation of files with tiny block
      sizes (and thus many blocks), which can degrade performance. Support multiple
      size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
2,dfs.journalnode.edit-cache-size.bytes,1048576,"The size, in bytes, of the in-memory cache of edits to keep on the
    JournalNode. This cache is used to serve edits for tailing via the RPC-based
    mechanism, and is only enabled when dfs.ha.tail-edits.in-progress is true.
    Transactions range in size but are around 200 bytes on average, so the
    default of 1MB can store around 5000 transactions."

8,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
9,dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec,1000,"The report compilation threads are limited to only running for
  a given number of milliseconds per second, as configured by the
  property. The limit is taken per thread, not in aggregate, e.g. setting
  a limit of 100ms for 4 compiler threads will result in each thread being
  limited to 100ms, not 25ms.

  Note that the throttle does not interrupt the report compiler threads, so the
  actual running time of the threads per second will typically be somewhat
  higher than the throttle limit, usually by no more than 20%.

  Setting this limit to 1000 disables compiler thread throttling. Only
  values between 1 and 1000 are valid. Setting an invalid value will result
  in the throttle being disabled and an error message being logged. 1000 is
  the default setting."
