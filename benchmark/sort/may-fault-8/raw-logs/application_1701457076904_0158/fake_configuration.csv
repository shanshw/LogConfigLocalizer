0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.resourcemanager.container.liveness-monitor.interval-ms,600000,
2,mapreduce.task.io.sort.factor,10,"The number of streams to merge at once while sorting
  files.  This determines the number of open file handles."
3,ipc.server.purge.interval,15,"Define how often calls are cleaned up in the server.
    The default is 15 minutes. The unit is minutes."
4,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
5,yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups,0,"If yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.shuffle.log.backups are greater than zero
    then a ContainerRollngLogAppender is used instead of ContainerLogAppender
    for syslog.shuffle. See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex"
6,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."
7,mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedjobs.cache.size,5,"Size of the loaded job cache.  This property is ignored if
  the property mapreduce.jobhistory.loadedtasks.cache.size is set to a
  positive value."

      defaults to 0."
9,dfs.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
