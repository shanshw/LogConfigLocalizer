  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.zk.timeout-ms,10000,"ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. Session expiration
    is managed by the ZooKeeper cluster itself, not by the client. This value is
    used by the cluster to determine when the client's session expires.
    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within

  In other words, framework will try to execute a reduce task these many number

5,dfs.datanode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the DataNode logs its metrics. The
