io.bytes.per.checksum,206984773,"2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space","The error log indicates an OutOfMemoryError, which could be caused by the large value of 'io.bytes.per.checksum'. This configuration determines the number of bytes per checksum, and if it's too large, it could lead to memory issues."
dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit,2048,"2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space","The 'dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-limit' configuration could also be a potential cause for the OutOfMemoryError. This configuration limits the number of arrays allowed for each array length. If the limit is too high, it could lead to excessive memory usage."

Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space","The 'dfs.balancer.getBlocks.min-block-size' configuration could be another potential cause for the OutOfMemoryError. This configuration sets the minimum block threshold size in bytes to ignore when fetching a source's block list. If the value is too high, it could lead to excessive memory usage."
