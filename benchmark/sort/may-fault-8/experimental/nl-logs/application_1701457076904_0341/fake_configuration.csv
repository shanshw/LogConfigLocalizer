    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."

      signature exceeds the maximum allowed bytes in server, the caller context
      will be abandoned, in which case the caller context will not be recorded
      in audit logs."

8,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
