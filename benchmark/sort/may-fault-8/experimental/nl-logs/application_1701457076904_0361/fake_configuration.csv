0,io.bytes.per.checksum,663195128,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age,86400,"Minimum age in seconds of multipart uploads to purge
    on startup if ""fs.s3a.multipart.purge"" is true"
2,dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby
      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize."
3,mapreduce.job.reducer.unconditional-preempt.delay.sec,300,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers a forced reducer preemption irrespective of the
      anticipated headroom. By default, it is set to 5 mins. Setting it to 0
      leads to immediate reducer preemption. Setting to -1 disables this
      preemption altogether."
4,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.max.outstanding.paths,10000,"Defines the maximum number of paths to satisfy that can be queued up in the
    Satisfier call queue in a period of time. Default value is 10000."

6,mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during merge before
   sending a progress notification to the MR ApplicationMaster."
7,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.renew-interval,86400000,The renewal interval for delegation token in milliseconds.
8,io.mapfile.bloom.size,1048576,"The size of BloomFilter-s used in BloomMapFile. Each time this many
  keys is appended the next BloomFilter will be created (inside a DynamicBloomFilter).
  Larger values minimize the number of filters, which slightly increases the performance,
  but may waste too much space if the total number of keys is usually much smaller
  than this number."
