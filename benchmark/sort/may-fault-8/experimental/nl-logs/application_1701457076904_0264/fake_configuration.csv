    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."

  In other words, framework will try to execute a reduce task these many number

8,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,100,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
9,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
