0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1871270027,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
2,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.expire-after-access-minutes,5,"The length of time after an entry is last accessed that it
    should be automatically removed."
3,yarn.resourcemanager.rm.container-allocation.expiry-interval-ms,600000,
4,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.parallelcopies,5,"The default number of parallel transfers run by reduce
  during the copy(shuffle) phase."
5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattr-size,16384,"The maximum combined size of the name and value of an extended attribute
    in bytes. It should be larger than 0, and less than or equal to maximum
    size hard limit which is 32768.
    Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
    dfs.blocksize."
6,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for writing.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
7,yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms,5000,
8,fs.permissions.umask-mode,22,"The umask used when creating files and directories.
    Can be in octal or in symbolic. Examples are:
    ""022"" (octal for u=rwx,g=r-x,o=r-x in symbolic),
    or ""u=rwx,g=rwx,o="" (symbolic for 007 in octal)."
9,dfs.datanode.max.slowdisks.to.exclude,0,"The number of slow disks that needs to be excluded. By default, this parameter is set to 0,
    which disables excluding slow disk when choosing volume."
