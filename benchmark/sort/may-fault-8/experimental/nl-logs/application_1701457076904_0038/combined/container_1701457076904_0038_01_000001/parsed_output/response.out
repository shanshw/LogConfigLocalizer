explanation:The dfs.client-write-packet-size is related to the size of the data that the client writes to the server. If the value is too small, it may cause frequent disk I/O operations, which may lead to OutOfMemoryError.

value:0
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error. Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation:The dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated configuration is set to 0, which means that if any volume fails, the datanode will shutdown. This could be the reason for the abrupt shutdown of the system.
