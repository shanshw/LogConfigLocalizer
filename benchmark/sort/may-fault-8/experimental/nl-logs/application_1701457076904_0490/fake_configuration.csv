0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.datanode.socket.reuse.keepalive,4000,"The window of time in ms before the DataXceiver closes a socket for a
    single request.  If a second request occurs within that window, the
    socket can be reused."
2,dfs.qjournal.get-journal-state.timeout.ms,120000,"Timeout in milliseconds when calling getJournalState().
    JournalNodes."
3,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."
4,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size,1048576,Buffer size in bytes for short-circuit local reads.
5,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
6,dfs.namenode.reencrypt.batch.size,1000,How many EDEKs should the re-encrypt thread process in one batch.
7,io.file.buffer.size,4096,"The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
8,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
9,dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report,5,"Number of nodes to include in JSON report. We will return nodes with
    the highest number of votes from peers."
