1,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams-hard-limit,4,Hard limit for all replication streams.
2,mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.interval,1000,"The number of milliseconds the submitter of the job wants to
    wait before job end notification is retried if it fails. This is capped by

4,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."

6,fs.s3a.connection.maximum,96,"Controls the maximum number of simultaneous connections to S3.
    This must be bigger than the value of fs.s3a.threads.max so as to stop

8,dfs.replication.max,512,Maximal block replication.
9,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."
