0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval,3,"Minimum number of missed heartbeats intervals for a datanode to
    be marked stale by the Namenode.  The actual interval is calculated as
    (dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.minimum.interval * dfs.heartbeat.interval)
    in seconds.  If this value is greater than the property
    dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval, then the calculated value above
    is used."
2,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
3,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
4,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.rpc.threads,20,The maximum number of threads to use for calling RPC call to recheck the liveness of dead node.
5,yarn.nodemanager.node-attributes.resync-interval-ms,120000,
6,dfs.namenode.max.op.size,52428800,Maximum opcode size in bytes.
7,dfs.namenode.max-num-blocks-to-log,1000,"Puts a limit on the number of blocks printed to the log by the Namenode
    after a block report."
8,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
9,dfs.default.chunk.view.size,32768,The number of bytes to view for a file on the browser.
