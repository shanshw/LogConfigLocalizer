0,io.bytes.per.checksum,463005764,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces,1,"Threshold for number of reduces, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  CURRENTLY THE CODE CANNOT SUPPORT
  MORE THAN ONE REDUCE and will ignore larger values.  (Zero is a valid max,
  however.)  Users may override this value, but only downward."

      DFSInputStreams. If a DFSClient opens many DFSInputStreams, increasing
      this may help refresh them all in a timely manner."

    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA

  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
