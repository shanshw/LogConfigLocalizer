0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout,10000,"The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a
    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."
2,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
3,dfs.client.max.block.acquire.failures,3,Maximum failures allowed when trying to get block information from a specific datanode.
4,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,256,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
5,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
6,ftp.client-write-packet-size,65536,Packet size for clients to write
7,dfs.disk.balancer.plan.threshold.percent,10,"The percentage threshold value for volume Data Density in a plan.
      If the absolute value of volume Data Density which is out of
      threshold value in a node, it means that the volumes corresponding to
      the disks should do the balancing in the plan. The default value is 10."
8,file.replication,1,Replication factor
9,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
