2,dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,"Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent."

               to establish a server connection."
5,dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval,30000,"Default time interval in milliseconds for marking a datanode as ""stale"",
    i.e., if the namenode has not received heartbeat msg from a datanode for
    more than this time interval, the datanode will be marked and treated 
    as ""stale"" by default. The stale interval cannot be too small since 
    otherwise this may cause too frequent change of stale states. 
    We thus set a minimum stale interval value (the default value is 3 times 
    of heartbeat interval) and guarantee that the stale interval cannot be less
    than the minimum value. A stale data node is avoided during lease/block
    recovery. It can be conditionally avoided for reads (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode) and for writes (see
    dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode)."
6,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."
