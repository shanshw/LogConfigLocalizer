0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.top.num.users,10,Number of top users returned by the top tool
2,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
3,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
4,yarn.sharedcache.cleaner.resource-sleep-ms,0,
5,dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms,3600000,"The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated.

    By default this parameter is set to 1 hour.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
6,fs.ftp.timeout,0,FTP filesystem's timeout in seconds.
7,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms,30000,"The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
8,yarn.scheduler.configuration.leveldb-store.compaction-interval-secs,86400,
9,dfs.client.mmap.cache.size,256,"When zero-copy reads are used, the DFSClient keeps a cache of recently used
    memory mapped regions.  This parameter controls the maximum number of
    entries that we will keep in that cache.

    The larger this number is, the more file descriptors we will potentially
    use for memory-mapped files.  mmaped files also use virtual address space.
    You may need to increase your ulimit virtual address space limits before
    increasing the client mmap cache size.

    Note that you can still do zero-copy reads when this size is set to 0."
