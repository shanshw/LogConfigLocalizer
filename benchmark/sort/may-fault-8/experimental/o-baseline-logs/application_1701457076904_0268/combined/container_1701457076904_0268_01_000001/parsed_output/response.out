name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:601318601
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The error log indicates an OutOfMemoryError, which could be caused by the large value of 'io.bytes.per.checksum'. This configuration option determines the number of bytes per checksum, and it should not be larger than 'io.file.buffer.size'. The current value is excessively large, which might have caused the system to run out of memory.

value:65536
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The 'file.client-write-packet-size' configuration option could also be related to the OutOfMemoryError. This option determines the packet size for clients to write. If the packet size is too large, it could lead to memory issues. The current value seems to be reasonable, but it might still be worth investigating if it's causing the memory error.

name:mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.fetch.retry.timeout-ms
value:30000
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The 'mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.fetch.retry.timeout-ms' configuration option might be related to the error as well. This option determines the timeout value for the fetcher to retry to fetch again when some non-fatal failure happens. If the timeout is too short, it could lead to frequent retries, which could potentially cause memory issues. The current value seems to be reasonable, but it might still be worth investigating.
