0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,ipc.ping.interval,60000,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  The client will send ping when the interval is passed without receiving bytes,
  if ipc.client.ping is set to true."
2,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
3,ha.health-monitor.rpc-timeout.ms,45000,Timeout for the actual monitorHealth() calls.
4,yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.image-tag-to-manifest-plugin.cache-refresh-interval-secs,60,
5,hadoop.security.uid.cache.secs,14400,"This is the config controlling the validity of the entries in the cache
        containing the userId to userName and groupId to groupName used by
        NativeIO getFstat()."
6,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,900000,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
7,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
8,file.replication,1,Replication factor
9,dfs.client.datanode-restart.timeout,30,"Expert only. The time to wait, in seconds, from reception of an
    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
