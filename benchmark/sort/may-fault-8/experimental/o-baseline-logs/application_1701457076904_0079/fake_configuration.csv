  io.file.buffer.size."
1,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."

    should be automatically removed."
4,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
