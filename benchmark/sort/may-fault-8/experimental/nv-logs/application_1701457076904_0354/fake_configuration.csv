0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,io.seqfile.compress.blocksize,1000000,"The minimum block size for compression in block compressed
          SequenceFiles."
2,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
3,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.recheck.timeout.millis,60000,"Blocks storage movements monitor re-check interval in milliseconds.
    This check will verify whether any blocks storage movement results arrived from DN
    and also verify if any of file blocks movements not at all reported to DN
    since dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.
    The default value is 1 * 60 * 1000 (1 mins)"
4,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.work.multiplier.per.iteration,1,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    one iteration, for satisfy the policy. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately. This number can be any positive, non-zero integer."

    one rpc call to the namenode.If less or equal to zero, at most
    DFS_NAMENODE_SNAPSHOT_DIFF_LISTING_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be sent
    across to the client within one rpc call."
