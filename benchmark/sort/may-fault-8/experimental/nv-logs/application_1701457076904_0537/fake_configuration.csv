0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1985015058,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."

2,io.file.buffer.size,4096,"The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
3,dfs.client.socketcache.expiryMsec,3000,Socket cache expiration for short-circuit reads in msec.

5,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."

9,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps,9,"Threshold for number of maps, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  Users may override this value,
  but only downward."
