0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.qjournal.accept-recovery.timeout.ms,120000,"Quorum timeout in milliseconds during accept phase of
    recovery/synchronization for a specific segment."
2,ipc.[port_number].decay-scheduler.period-ms,5000,"How frequently the decay factor should be applied to the
    operation counts of users. Higher values have less overhead, but respond
    less quickly to changes in client behavior.
    This property applies to DecayRpcScheduler."
3,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattr-size,16384,"The maximum combined size of the name and value of an extended attribute
    in bytes. It should be larger than 0, and less than or equal to maximum
    size hard limit which is 32768.
    Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
    dfs.blocksize."
4,dfs.webhdfs.netty.high.watermark,65535,High watermark configuration to Netty for Datanode WebHdfs.
5,seq.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files,
      while using SequenceFile.Sorter, in megabytes. By default,
      gives each merge stream 1MB, which should minimize seeks."
6,dfs.namenode.replication.work.multiplier.per.iteration,2,"*Note*: Advanced property. Change with caution.
    This determines the total amount of block transfers to begin in
    parallel at a DN, for replication, when such a command list is being
    sent over a DN heartbeat by the NN. The actual number is obtained by
    multiplying this multiplier with the total number of live nodes in the
    cluster. The result number is the number of blocks to begin transfers
    immediately for, per DN heartbeat. This number can be any positive,
    non-zero integer."
7,mapreduce.task.exit.timeout.check-interval-ms,20000,"The interval in milliseconds between which the MR framework
  checks if task attempts stay in finishing state for too long."

    0 disables the cap."
9,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
