0,io.bytes.per.checksum,701922470,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.jobhistory.intermediate-user-done-dir.permissions,770,"The permissions of the user directories in
  ${mapreduce.jobhistory.intermediate-done-dir}. The user and the group
  permission must be 7, this is enforced."
2,dfs.datanode.handler.count,10,The number of server threads for the datanode.
3,dfs.client-write-packet-size,65536,Packet size for clients to write
4,hadoop.security.key.default.bitlength,128,"The length (bits) of keys we want the KeyProvider to produce. Key length
    defines the upper-bound on an algorithm's security, ideally, it would
    coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security."
5,dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,"The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume."

    something that is not cached, it must direct the DataNodes to do so by
    sending a DNA_CACHE or DNA_UNCACHE command in response to a DataNode
    heartbeat.  This parameter controls how frequently the NameNode will
    resend these commands."

               after which new tasks of that job aren't assigned to it. It
