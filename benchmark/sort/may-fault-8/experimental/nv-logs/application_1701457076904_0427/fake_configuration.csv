3,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."

5,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
6,dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring image to bootstrap standby
      namenode, in bytes per second.
      A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled. This default
      value should be used in most cases, to ensure timely HA operations.
      The maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers is configured
      with dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec.
      Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
      dfs.blocksize."
7,file.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
8,file.replication,1,Replication factor
9,dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,"Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent."
