  non-fatal failure happens because of some events like NM restart."
2,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms,500,"How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have
    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
3,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.connection.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the connection timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."
