0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.timeline-service.client.fd-flush-interval-secs,10,
2,yarn.sharedcache.nm.uploader.replication.factor,10,
3,dfs.client.hedged.read.threadpool.size,0,"Support 'hedged' reads in DFSClient. To enable this feature, set the parameter
    to a positive number. The threadpool size is how many threads to dedicate
    to the running of these 'hedged', concurrent reads in your client."
4,dfs.http.client.retry.max.attempts,10,"Specify the max number of retry attempts for WebHDFS client,
    if the difference between retried attempts and failovered attempts is
    larger than the max number of retry attempts, there will be no more
    retries."
5,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
6,hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity,36000,"Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed."
7,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
8,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns,1000000,"The Secondary NameNode or CheckpointNode will create a checkpoint
  of the namespace every 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.txns' transactions, regardless
  of whether 'dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period' has expired."
9,dfs.namenode.maintenance.replication.min,1,Minimal live block replication in existence of maintenance mode.
