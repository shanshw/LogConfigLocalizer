  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.heartbeat.interval,3,"Determines datanode heartbeat interval in seconds.
    Can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
    ms(millis), s(sec), m(min), h(hour), d(day)
    to specify the time (such as 2s, 2m, 1h, etc.).
    Or provide complete number in seconds (such as 30 for 30 seconds).
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."

    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level

    30 is a good value for WASB"
9,dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,"The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
