    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will

    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
