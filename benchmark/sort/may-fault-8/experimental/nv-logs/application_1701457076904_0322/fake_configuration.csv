0,io.bytes.per.checksum,815869039,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval,300000,"This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond."

3,mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting
  files, in megabytes.  By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which
  should minimize seeks."
4,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."

6,dfs.namenode.list.openfiles.num.responses,1000,"When listing open files, the maximum number of open files that will be

    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't establish a connection within the
    specified period, it will abort the connect attempt. Non-positive value
    means no LDAP connection timeout is specified in which case it waits for the
    connection to establish until the underlying network times out."
