0,io.bytes.per.checksum,240470161,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.namenode.snapshot.skiplist.max.levels,0,"Maximum no of the skip levels to be maintained in the skip list for
    storing directory snapshot diffs. By default, it is set to 0 and a linear
    list will be used to store the directory snapshot diffs."
2,dfs.namenode.metrics.logger.period.seconds,600,"This setting controls how frequently the NameNode logs its metrics. The
    logging configuration must also define one or more appenders for
    NameNodeMetricsLog for the metrics to be logged.
    NameNode metrics logging is disabled if this value is set to zero or
    less than zero."
3,dfs.client.mmap.cache.timeout.ms,3600000,"The minimum length of time that we will keep an mmap entry in the cache
    between uses.  If an entry is in the cache longer than this, and nobody
    uses it, it will be removed by a background thread."
4,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-component-length,255,"Defines the maximum number of bytes in UTF-8 encoding in each
      component of a path.  A value of 0 will disable the check. Support
      multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.blocksize."
5,dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory,0,"The amount of memory in bytes to use for caching of block replicas in
    memory on the datanode. The datanode's maximum locked memory soft ulimit
    (RLIMIT_MEMLOCK) must be set to at least this value, else the datanode
    will abort on startup. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
    as described in dfs.blocksize.

    By default, this parameter is set to 0, which disables in-memory caching.

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."
6,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.recheck.timeout.millis,60000,"Blocks storage movements monitor re-check interval in milliseconds.
    This check will verify whether any blocks storage movement results arrived from DN
    and also verify if any of file blocks movements not at all reported to DN
    since dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.self.retry.timeout.
    The default value is 1 * 60 * 1000 (1 mins)"
7,dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms,300000,"How often an active namenode will check if it needs to roll its edit log,
    in milliseconds."
