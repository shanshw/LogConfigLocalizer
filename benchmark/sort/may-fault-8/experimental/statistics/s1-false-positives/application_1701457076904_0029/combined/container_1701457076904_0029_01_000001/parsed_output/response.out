name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007
explanation:The configuration for the number of bytes per checksum is missing. This could potentially cause issues with data integrity and might be the cause of the task speculation.

name:mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval
value:5000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007
explanation:The poll interval for job status updates is set to 5000 milliseconds. This could potentially cause delays in task completion and might be the reason for the task speculation.

name:mapreduce.map.cpu.vcores
value:1
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007
explanation:The number of virtual cores requested for each map task is set to 1. This could potentially cause resource constraints and might be the reason for the task speculation.
