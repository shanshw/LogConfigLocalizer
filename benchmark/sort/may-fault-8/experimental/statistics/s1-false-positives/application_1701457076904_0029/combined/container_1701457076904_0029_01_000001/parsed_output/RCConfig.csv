io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007,The configuration for the number of bytes per checksum is missing. This could potentially cause issues with data integrity and might be the cause of the task speculation.
mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval,5000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007,The poll interval for job status updates is set to 5000 milliseconds. This could potentially cause delays in task completion and might be the reason for the task speculation.
mapreduce.map.cpu.vcores,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0029_m_000007,The number of virtual cores requested for each map task is set to 1. This could potentially cause resource constraints and might be the reason for the task speculation.
