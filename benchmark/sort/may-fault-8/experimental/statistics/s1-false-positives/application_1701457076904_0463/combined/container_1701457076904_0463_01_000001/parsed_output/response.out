name:dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval
value:556030301
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0463_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates that a speculative task is being initiated. This could be due to the system detecting a slow or stale datanode. The dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval configuration option determines the interval to check for expired datanodes. If this value is too high, it could lead to unnecessary speculation of tasks.

name:mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data.buffer.kb
value:128
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0463_m_000008
explanation: The mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data.buffer.kb configuration option determines the buffer size for intermediate encrypted data. If this value is too low, it could lead to slow task performance and trigger unnecessary speculation.

name:dfs.client.retry.interval-ms.get-last-block-length
value:4000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0463_m_000008
explanation: The dfs.client.retry.interval-ms.get-last-block-length configuration option determines the retry interval in milliseconds to wait between retries in getting block lengths from the datanodes. If this value is too high, it could lead to slow task performance and trigger unnecessary speculation.
