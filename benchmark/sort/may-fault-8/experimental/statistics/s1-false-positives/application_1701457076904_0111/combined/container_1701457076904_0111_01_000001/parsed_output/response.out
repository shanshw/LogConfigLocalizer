name:yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms

relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0111_m_000008
explanation:The log indicates that a task is being speculated, which could be due to the application master not being killed in time. The configuration option 'yarn.app.mapreduce.am.hard-kill-timeout-ms' controls the time before the job client kills the application. If this time is too short, it may cause premature speculation of tasks.

relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0111_m_000008
explanation:The speculation of tasks could also be related to the rolling interval of the master key for container tokens. If the interval is too long, it may cause delays in the renewal of container tokens, which could lead to speculation of tasks.

value:100
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0111_m_000008
explanation:The number of decommission-in-progress or entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that are tracked at one time by the namenode could also affect the speculation of tasks. If the number is too high, it may consume additional NN memory and cause delays in task execution, leading to speculation.
