yarn.timeline-service.client.retry-interval-ms,hSPiR,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0139_m_000009,"The value of this configuration option is not a valid integer, which may cause errors when the system tries to interpret it as the retry interval in milliseconds for the YARN timeline service client. This could potentially lead to issues with task speculation, as indicated in the log."
yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory.cgroups.swappiness,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0139_m_000009,"The value of this configuration option is set to 0, which means that the system will not use swap space at all. This could potentially lead to memory issues, especially if the system is running memory-intensive tasks, as indicated in the log."
dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0139_m_000009,"The value of this configuration option is set to 0, which means that the system will not set a specific buffer size for receiving packets from the client during block writing. This could potentially lead to issues with TCP connection throughput, especially if the system is running data-intensive tasks, as indicated in the log."
