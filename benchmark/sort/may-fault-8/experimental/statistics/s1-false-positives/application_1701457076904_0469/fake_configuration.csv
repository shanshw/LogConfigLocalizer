0,dfs.client.retry.max.attempts,,Max retry attempts for DFSClient talking to namenodes.
1,dfs.qjournal.http.read.timeout.ms,60000,"Timeout in milliseconds when reading from a HTTP connection from remote
    journals."
2,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.polling.ms,500,"How often the DataNode should poll to see if the clients have
    stopped using a replica that the DataNode wants to uncache."
3,dfs.namenode.delegation.token.max-lifetime,604800000,"The maximum lifetime in milliseconds for which a delegation 
      token is valid."
4,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-directory-items,1048576,"Defines the maximum number of items that a directory may
      contain. Cannot set the property to a value less than 1 or more than
      6400000."
5,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."

8,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,10000,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
9,dfs.client.write.exclude.nodes.cache.expiry.interval.millis,600000,"The maximum period to keep a DN in the excluded nodes list
  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."
