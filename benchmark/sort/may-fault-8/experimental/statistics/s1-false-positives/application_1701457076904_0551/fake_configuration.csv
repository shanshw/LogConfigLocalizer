0,hadoop.shell.safely.delete.limit.num.files,,"Used by -safely option of hadoop fs shell -rm command to avoid
      accidental deletion of large directories. When enabled, the -rm command
      requires confirmation if the number of files to be deleted is greater than
      this limit.  The default limit is 100 files. The warning is disabled if
      the limit is 0 or the -safely is not specified in -rm command."
1,dfs.image.parallel.inode.threshold,1000000,"If the image contains less inodes than this setting, then
        do not write sub-sections and hence disable parallel loading.
        This is because small images load very quickly in serial and
        parallel loading is not needed."
2,dfs.namenode.heartbeat.recheck-interval,300000,"This time decides the interval to check for expired datanodes.
    With this value and dfs.heartbeat.interval, the interval of
    deciding the datanode is stale or not is also calculated.
    The unit of this configuration is millisecond."
3,dfs.namenode.service.handler.count,10,"The number of Namenode RPC server threads that listen to
  requests from DataNodes and from all other non-client nodes.
  dfs.namenode.service.handler.count will be valid only if
  dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address is configured."

5,hadoop.security.dns.log-slow-lookups.threshold.ms,1000,"If slow lookup logging is enabled, this threshold is used to decide if a
    lookup is considered slow enough to be logged."
6,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
7,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.period,3600,"The number of seconds between two periodic checkpoints.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
