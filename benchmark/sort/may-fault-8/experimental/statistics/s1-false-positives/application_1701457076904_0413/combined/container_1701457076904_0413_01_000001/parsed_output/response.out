name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0413_m_000008
explanation: The missing value for the number of bytes per checksum could cause errors during data transfer, which might be the cause of the task speculation.

name:dfs.datanode.data.write.bandwidthPerSec
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0413_m_000008
explanation: The bandwidth for data transfer is set to zero, which means there is no limit. This could lead to overuse of resources and cause the task to be speculated.

name:dfs.client.block.write.replace-datanode-on-failure.min-replication
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0413_m_000008
explanation: The minimum number of replications is set to zero, which means that if a datanode fails and cannot be replaced, an exception will be thrown. This could be the cause of the task speculation.
