0,dfs.datanode.cache.revocation.timeout.ms,-0.7346693,"When the DFSClient reads from a block file which the DataNode is
    caching, the DFSClient can skip verifying checksums.  The DataNode will
    keep the block file in cache until the client is done.  If the client takes
    an unusually long time, though, the DataNode may need to evict the block
    file from the cache anyway.  This value controls how long the DataNode will
    wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without
    checksums."
1,dfs.namenode.lazypersist.file.scrub.interval.sec,300,"The NameNode periodically scans the namespace for LazyPersist files with
    missing blocks and unlinks them from the namespace. This configuration key
    controls the interval between successive scans. If this value is set to 0,
    the file scrubber is disabled."
2,dfs.balancer.max-size-to-move,10737418240,"Maximum number of bytes that can be moved by the balancer in a single
    thread."

4,mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.interval,1000,"The number of milliseconds the submitter of the job wants to
    wait before job end notification is retried if it fails. This is capped by
    mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval"
5,dfs.checksum.ec.socket-timeout,3000,"Default timeout value in milliseconds for computing the checksum of striped blocks.
    Recommended to set the same value between client and DNs in a cluster because mismatching
    may cause exhausting handler threads."
6,dfs.content-summary.limit,5000,"The maximum content summary counts allowed in one locking period. 0 or a negative number
    means no limit (i.e. no yielding)."
7,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,0,"The maximum size (in MB) a map reduce job is allowed to submit
    for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command line
    arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
8,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.buffer.size,1048576,Buffer size in bytes for short-circuit local reads.
9,dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,"The number of volumes that are allowed to
  fail before a datanode stops offering service. By default
  any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown.
  The value should be greater than or equal to -1 , -1 represents minimum
  1 valid volume."
