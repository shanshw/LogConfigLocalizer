It controls how long the DataNode will wait for the client to release a replica that it is reading without checksums. The negative value might cause the DataNode to behave unexpectedly.
mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0402_m_000009,"The value of this configuration is set to 0, which means there is no limit for the maximum size a map reduce job is allowed to submit for localization. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if a job submits a large amount of data for localization."
dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0402_m_000009,"The value of this configuration is set to 0, which means any volume failure will cause a datanode to shutdown. This could potentially lead to service interruption if there is any volume failure."
