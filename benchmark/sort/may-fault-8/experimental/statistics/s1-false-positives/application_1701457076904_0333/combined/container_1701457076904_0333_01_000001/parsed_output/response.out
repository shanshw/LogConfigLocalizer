relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0333_m_000009
explanation:This configuration option is related to the delay before a reducer is preempted in MapReduce. The value of 0 means the reducer is preempted as soon as lack of headroom is detected, which might cause issues in task speculation.

name:ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms
value:10000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0333_m_000009
explanation:This configuration option is related to the session timeout when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper. The value of 10000 might be too low, causing premature session timeouts and potentially affecting task speculation.
