1,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts.before.failover,3,"This property is the number of attempts to be made for LDAP operations
    using a single LDAP instance. If multiple LDAP servers are configured
    and this number of failed operations is reached, we will switch to the
    next LDAP server. The configuration for the overall number of attempts
    will still be respected, failover will thus be performed only if this
    property is less than hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.num.attempts."

3,mapreduce.job.reducer.preempt.delay.sec,0,"The threshold (in seconds) after which an unsatisfied
      mapper request triggers reducer preemption when there is no anticipated
      headroom. If set to 0 or a negative value, the reducer is preempted as
      soon as lack of headroom is detected. Default is 0."

    in bytes. It should be larger than 0, and less than or equal to maximum
    size hard limit which is 32768.
    Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
    dfs.blocksize."

7,ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms,10000,"The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip."
