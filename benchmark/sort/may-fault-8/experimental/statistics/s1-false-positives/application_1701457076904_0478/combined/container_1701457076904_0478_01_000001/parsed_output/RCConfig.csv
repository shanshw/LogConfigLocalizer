mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources-mb,<missing>,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0478_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which may require additional resources for execution. The missing value for the maximum size a map reduce job is allowed to submit for localization could be causing issues with resource allocation for speculative tasks."
mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit,0,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0478_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be a reduce task. The configuration value of 0 for the maximum number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job could be causing issues with task scheduling and execution."
dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0478_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be due to failover attempts. The configuration value for the maximum time to wait between failovers could be causing issues with task failover and recovery."
