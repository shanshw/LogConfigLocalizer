    for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command line
    arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
1,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."

    datanode shutdown notification for quick restart, until declaring
    the datanode dead and invoking the normal recovery mechanisms.
    The notification is sent by a datanode when it is being shutdown
    using the shutdownDatanode admin command with the upgrade option.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If no time unit is specified then seconds
    is assumed."
