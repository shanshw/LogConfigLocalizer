0,dfs.provided.aliasmap.inmemory.batch-size,-0.33829856,The batch size when iterating over the database backing the aliasmap
1,dfs.namenode.safemode.extension,30000,"Determines extension of safe mode in milliseconds after the threshold level
    is reached.  Support multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
2,yarn.resourcemanager.zk-appid-node.split-index,0,
3,dfs.client.server-defaults.validity.period.ms,3600000,"The amount of milliseconds after which cached server defaults are updated.

    By default this parameter is set to 1 hour.
    Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
4,fs.trash.checkpoint.interval,0,"Number of minutes between trash checkpoints.
  Should be smaller or equal to fs.trash.interval. If zero,
  the value is set to the value of fs.trash.interval.
  Every time the checkpointer runs it creates a new checkpoint
  out of current and removes checkpoints created more than
  fs.trash.interval minutes ago."
5,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked

8,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
9,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
