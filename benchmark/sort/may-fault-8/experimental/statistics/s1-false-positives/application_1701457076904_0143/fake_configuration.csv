0,hadoop.security.crypto.buffer.size,,The buffer size used by CryptoInputStream and CryptoOutputStream.
1,dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms,400,"The initial delay (unit is ms) for locateFollowingBlock,
    the delay time will increase exponentially(double) for each retry
    until dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms is reached,
    after that the delay for each retry will be
    dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.max.delay.ms."
2,dfs.datanode.scan.period.hours,504,"If this is positive, the DataNode will not scan any
        individual block more than once in the specified scan period.
        If this is negative, the block scanner is disabled.
        If this is set to zero, then the default value of 504 hours
        or 3 weeks is used. Prior versions of HDFS incorrectly documented
        that setting this key to zero will disable the block scanner."
3,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
4,ipc.client.rpc-timeout.ms,0,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  If ipc.client.ping is set to true and this rpc-timeout is greater than
  the value of ipc.ping.interval, the effective value of the rpc-timeout is
  rounded up to multiple of ipc.ping.interval."
5,dfs.namenode.fs-limits.max-xattr-size,16384,"The maximum combined size of the name and value of an extended attribute
    in bytes. It should be larger than 0, and less than or equal to maximum
    size hard limit which is 32768.
    Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described in
    dfs.blocksize."
