name:dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0137_m_000009
explanation:The configuration dfs.datanode.directoryscan.interval is set to 0, which means the Datanode does not scan data directories and reconcile the difference between blocks in memory and on the disk. This could cause issues with data consistency and might be the reason for the speculative task execution.

name:mapreduce.map.maxattempts
value:4
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0137_m_000009
explanation:The configuration mapreduce.map.maxattempts is set to 4, which means the framework will try to execute a map task 4 times before giving up on it. The log indicates a speculative task execution, which might be due to the task failing multiple times.

name:dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume
value:4
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0137_m_000009
explanation:The configuration dfs.datanode.fsdatasetasyncdisk.max.threads.per.volume is set to 4, which limits the number of threads per volume used to process async disk operations on the datanode. This could potentially slow down data processing and might be the reason for the speculative task execution.
