io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0103_m_000009,The configuration 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing a value. This could be causing issues as it is required for the system to know the number of bytes per checksum. This could potentially affect tasks such as the one mentioned in the log.
yarn.resourcemanager.amlauncher.thread-count,50,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0103_m_000009,"The description for 'yarn.resourcemanager.amlauncher.thread-count' is missing. This configuration is important for managing the number of threads for the Application Master launcher. If not properly configured, it could affect the performance of tasks."
mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0103_m_000009,"The configuration 'mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit' is set to 0, which means there is no limit to the number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if too many tasks are running simultaneously."
