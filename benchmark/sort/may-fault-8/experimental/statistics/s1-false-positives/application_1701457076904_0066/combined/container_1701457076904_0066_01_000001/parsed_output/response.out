name:dfs.journalnode.sync.interval
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0066_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the synchronization of Journal Nodes. The dfs.journalnode.sync.interval is set to 0, which means there is no interval between two syncs. This could cause excessive resource usage and might be the root cause of the issue.

name:yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms
value:5000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0066_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the NodeManager's process management. The yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms is set to 5000ms, which might not be enough time for some processes to gracefully shut down, causing unexpected issues.

name:mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces
value:1
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0066_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the MapReduce job's ubertask configuration. The mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxreduces is set to 1, which means the system cannot support more than one reduce task. This could be a limitation that causes the issue.
