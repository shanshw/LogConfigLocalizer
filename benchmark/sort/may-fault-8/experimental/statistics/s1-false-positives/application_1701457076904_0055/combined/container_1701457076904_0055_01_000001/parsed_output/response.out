relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0055_m_000009
explanation:The log indicates that a speculative task is being created, which might be due to the high number of client retries to the Application Master (AM). The configuration value is unusually high, which might cause excessive speculative tasks and resource waste.
