value:231504901
relevant log:1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0014_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be related to the job end notification attempts. The high value of max attempts might cause unnecessary resource consumption.

value:10000
relevant log:1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0014_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be related to the scheduling wait time in the ResourceManager. The value of 10000ms might be too long and cause delays in task scheduling.

name:yarn.nodemanager.process-kill-wait.ms
value:5000
relevant log:1-DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0014_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be related to the process kill wait time in the NodeManager. The value of 5000ms might be too short and cause premature termination of tasks.
