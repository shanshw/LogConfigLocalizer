name:file.client-write-packet-size
value:sdN24
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0098_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which could be due to slow data writing. The configuration option 'file.client-write-packet-size' is relevant as it controls the packet size for clients to write. The current value 'sdN24' seems to be invalid as it should be a numerical value representing the size in bytes.

name:dfs.datanode.directoryscan.throttle.limit.ms.per.sec
value:1000
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: Although there is no direct log pointing to this configuration, the value of '1000' disables compiler thread throttling which might cause performance issues in the system. 

name:dfs.namenode.edit.log.autoroll.check.interval.ms
value:300000
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: This configuration option is related to the frequency of active namenode checking if it needs to roll its edit log. Although there is no direct log pointing to this configuration, it could be a potential cause of performance issues if the interval is set too short.
