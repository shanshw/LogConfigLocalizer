value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0375_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates that a task is being speculated. The configuration option 'mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections' is set to 0, which means there is no limit on the number of connections. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if too many tasks are being speculated simultaneously.

relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0375_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates that a task is being speculated. The configuration option 'mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit' is set to 0, which means there is no limit on the number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if too many tasks are being speculated simultaneously.
