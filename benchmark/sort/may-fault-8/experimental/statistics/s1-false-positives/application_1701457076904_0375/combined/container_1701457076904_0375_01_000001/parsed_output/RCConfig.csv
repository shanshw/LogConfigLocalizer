The configuration option 'yarn.nodemanager.default-container-executor.log-dirs.permissions' could be relevant as it might be affecting the permissions of the log directories, which could in turn affect the task execution."
mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0375_m_000008,"The log indicates that a task is being speculated. The configuration option 'mapreduce.shuffle.max.connections' is set to 0, which means there is no limit on the number of connections. This could potentially lead to resource exhaustion if too many tasks are being speculated simultaneously."
