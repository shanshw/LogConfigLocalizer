name:mapreduce.job.running.map.limit
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0110_m_000009
explanation: The log indicates that a speculative task is being added, which is a mechanism to handle slow running tasks in MapReduce. However, the configuration 'mapreduce.job.running.map.limit' is set to 0, which means no map tasks are allowed to run simultaneously. This could be the root cause of the issue.

name:yarn.dispatcher.drain-events.timeout
value:300000
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: The description for this configuration is missing, and it's not clear what the timeout value is used for. This could potentially cause issues if the timeout is not set appropriately.

name:yarn.nodemanager.container.stderr.tail.bytes
value:4096
relevant log:<missing>
explanation: The description for this configuration is also missing. This configuration is related to the amount of log information that can be captured from the stderr of a container. If this value is set too low, it might not capture enough information for debugging purposes.
