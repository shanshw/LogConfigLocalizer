mapreduce.job.reduces,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0145_m_000009,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being added, which is related to the number of reduce tasks. The configuration option 'mapreduce.job.reduces' controls the number of reduce tasks per job. If this value is not properly set, it may cause issues with task speculation."
mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0145_m_000009,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being added. The configuration option 'mapreduce.task.timeout' controls the timeout for a task. If this value is not properly set, it may cause tasks to be prematurely terminated, which could lead to the speculation of tasks."
mapreduce.input.lineinputformat.linespermap,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0145_m_000009,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being added. The configuration option 'mapreduce.input.lineinputformat.linespermap' controls the number of lines of input data to include in each split. If this value is not properly set, it may cause issues with task splitting, which could lead to the speculation of tasks."
