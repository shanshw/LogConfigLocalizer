0,fs.s3a.connection.timeout,0.023149252,Socket connection timeout in milliseconds.
1,mapreduce.jobhistory.cleaner.interval-ms,86400000,"How often the job history cleaner checks for files to delete,
  in milliseconds. Defaults to 86400000 (one day). Files are only deleted if
  they are older than mapreduce.jobhistory.max-age-ms."
2,dfs.image.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,52428800,"Maximum bandwidth used for regular image transfers (instead of
        bootstrapping the standby namenode), in bytes per second.
        This can help keep normal namenode operations responsive during
        checkpointing.
        A default value is 50mb per second.
        The maximum bandwidth used for bootstrapping standby namenode is
        configured with dfs.image.transfer-bootstrap-standby.bandwidthPerSec.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
3,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period,60,"How often, the StandbyNode and ObserverNode should check if there are new
    edit log entries ready to be consumed. This is the minimum period between
    checking; exponential backoff will be applied if no edits are found and
    dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max is configured. By default, no
    backoff is applied.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
4,mapreduce.input.lineinputformat.linespermap,1,"When using NLineInputFormat, the number of lines of input data
  to include in each split."
5,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size,0,"Socket send buffer size for DataXceiver (mirroring packets to downstream
    in pipeline). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
6,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
  Ignored when mapreduce.framework.name is ""local""."
7,fs.s3a.socket.send.buffer,8192,Socket send buffer hint to amazon connector. Represented in bytes.
8,dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,"The maximum number of threads per volume to use for caching new data
    on the datanode. These threads consume both I/O and CPU. This can affect
    normal datanode operations."
9,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
