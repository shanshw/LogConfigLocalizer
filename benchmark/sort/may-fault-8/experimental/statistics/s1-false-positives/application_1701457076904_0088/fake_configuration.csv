1,mapreduce.job.running.map.limit,0,"The maximum number of simultaneous map tasks per job.
  There is no limit if this value is 0 or negative."
2,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.connect.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task spends in trying to connect to a remote node for getting map output."
3,mapreduce.map.skip.maxrecords,0,"The number of acceptable skip records surrounding the bad
    record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever records(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."
4,mapreduce.job.ubertask.maxmaps,9,"Threshold for number of maps, beyond which job is considered
  too big for the ubertasking optimization.  Users may override this value,
  but only downward."
5,mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during combine output collection
   before sending a progress notification."

    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
7,ipc.[port_number].weighted-cost.response,1,"The weight multiplier to apply to the time spent in the
    RESPONSE phase which do not involve holding a lock.
    See org.apache.hadoop.ipc.ProcessingDetails.Timing for more details on
    this phase. This property applies to WeightedTimeCostProvider."
8,dfs.replication,3,"Default block replication. 
  The actual number of replications can be specified when the file is created.
  The default is used if replication is not specified in create time."
