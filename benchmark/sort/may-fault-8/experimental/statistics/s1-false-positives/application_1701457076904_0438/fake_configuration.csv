1,dfs.journalnode.sync.interval,120000,"Time interval, in milliseconds, between two Journal Node syncs.
    This configuration takes effect only if the journalnode sync is enabled
    by setting the configuration parameter dfs.journalnode.enable.sync to true."
2,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."
3,dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.buffer.size,128,"Only used when enables asynchronous audit log. Sets the number of audit
    logs allowed in the event buffer before the calling thread is blocked
    (if dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.blocking is true) or until logs are
    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."
4,hadoop.kerberos.min.seconds.before.relogin,60,"The minimum time between relogin attempts for Kerberos, in
    seconds."
5,dfs.block.misreplication.processing.limit,10000,Maximum number of blocks to process for initializing replication queues.
6,fs.du.interval,600000,File space usage statistics refresh interval in msec.

9,dfs.namenode.list.reencryption.status.num.responses,100,"When listing re-encryption status, the maximum number of zones
    that will be returned in a batch. Fetching the list incrementally in
    batches improves namenode performance."
