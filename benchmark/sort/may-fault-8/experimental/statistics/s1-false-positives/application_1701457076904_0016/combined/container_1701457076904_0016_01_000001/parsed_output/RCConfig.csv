dfs.namenode.accesstime.precision,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0016_m_000008,The access time for HDFS file is precise up to this value. The default value is 1 hour. Setting a value of 0 disables access times for HDFS. This could be causing issues with file access times during task speculation.
dfs.balancer.moverThreads,1000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0016_m_000008,This configuration controls the thread pool size for executing block moves. A high value like 1000 could be causing resource contention issues during task speculation.
yarn.resourcemanager.opportunistic-container-allocation.nodes-used,10,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0016_m_000008,"This configuration controls the number of nodes used for opportunistic container allocation. The description is missing, but a low value like 10 could be limiting the resources available for task speculation."
