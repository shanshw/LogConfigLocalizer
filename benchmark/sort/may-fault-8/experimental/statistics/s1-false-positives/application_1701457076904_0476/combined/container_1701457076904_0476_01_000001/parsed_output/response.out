name:mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data-key-size-bits
value:666005954
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0476_m_000008
explanation:The value of this configuration is unusually high. The default value is 128, and this high value may cause issues with the encryption and decryption of data, which could lead to the speculation of tasks.

name:mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb
value:100
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0476_m_000008
explanation:The value of this configuration determines the total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting files. If this value is not set properly, it could lead to inefficient sorting and hence the speculation of tasks.

name:yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.dispatcher.pool-size
value:10
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0476_m_000008
explanation:The description of this configuration is missing. This configuration determines the number of threads in the pool for the system metrics publisher dispatcher. If this value is not set properly, it could lead to inefficient dispatching of system metrics, which could lead to the speculation of tasks.
