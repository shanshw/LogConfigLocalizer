3,mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb,100,"The total amount of buffer memory to use while sorting
  files, in megabytes.  By default, gives each merge stream 1MB, which
  should minimize seeks."

5,dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,2,Hard limit for the number of replication streams other than those with highest-priority.
6,dfs.ha.tail-edits.period.backoff-max,0,"The maximum time the tailer should wait between checking for new edit log
    entries. Exponential backoff will be applied when an edit log tail is
    performed but no edits are available to be read. Values less than or
    equal to zero disable backoff entirely; this is the default behavior.
    Supports multiple time unit suffix (case insensitive), as described
    in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
7,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.read.timeout.ms,60000,"This property is the read timeout (in milliseconds) for LDAP
    operations. If the LDAP provider doesn't get a LDAP response within the
    specified period, it will abort the read attempt. Non-positive value
    means no read timeout is specified in which case it waits for the response
    infinitely."

    disks with the highest latency."
9,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout,10000,"The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a
    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."
