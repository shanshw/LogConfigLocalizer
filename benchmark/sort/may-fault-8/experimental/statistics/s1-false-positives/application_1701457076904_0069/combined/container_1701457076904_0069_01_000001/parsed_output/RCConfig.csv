hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0069_m_000007,"The configuration option 'hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.base.millis' is missing a value. This option is responsible for the time to wait between failover attempts. The absence of a value could lead to immediate retries without any delay, which might cause the system to speculate tasks prematurely."
dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume,4,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0069_m_000007,"The configuration option 'dfs.datanode.fsdatasetcache.max.threads.per.volume' is set to 4. This option determines the maximum number of threads per volume used for caching new data on the datanode. If the number of threads is too low, it might affect normal datanode operations and lead to task speculation."
yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.layer-mounts-interval-secs,600,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0069_m_000007,"The configuration option 'yarn.nodemanager.runtime.linux.runc.layer-mounts-interval-secs' is set to 600. This option determines the interval for layer mounts in seconds. If the interval is too long, it might delay the task execution and lead to task speculation."
