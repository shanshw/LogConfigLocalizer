name:mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.retry-delay.max.ms
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0451_m_000008
explanation: The task is being speculated, which might be due to the reducer retrying to download map data. The value of this configuration is set to 0, which means the reducer will not delay before retrying, potentially causing excessive retries and speculation.

name:dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
value:15000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0451_m_000008
explanation: The task is being speculated, which might be due to failover attempts. The maximum time to wait between failovers is set to 15000 milliseconds. If the failover attempts are frequent, this could lead to speculation.

name:fs.s3a.attempts.maximum
value:20
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0451_m_000008
explanation: The task is being speculated, which might be due to transient errors causing retries. The maximum number of retry attempts is set to 20, which could lead to speculation if the number of errors is high.
