name:dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0233_m_000009
explanation:The configuration 'dfs.datanode.max.nodes.to.report' is missing a value. This configuration is responsible for the number of nodes to include in JSON report. The absence of this value might cause issues in reporting and could be related to the task speculation mentioned in the log.

name:mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval
value:5000.0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0233_m_000009
explanation:The configuration 'mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval' is set to 5000.0 milliseconds. This configuration determines the interval between which the JobClient polls the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for updates about job status. If this value is too high, it might delay the detection of task completion, which could lead to unnecessary task speculation as seen in the log.

name:yarn.nodemanager.recovery.compaction-interval-secs
value:3600.0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0233_m_000009
explanation:The configuration 'yarn.nodemanager.recovery.compaction-interval-secs' is set to 3600.0 seconds. This configuration is related to the NodeManager's recovery process. If the interval is too long, it might delay the recovery of failed tasks, which could lead to unnecessary task speculation as seen in the log.
