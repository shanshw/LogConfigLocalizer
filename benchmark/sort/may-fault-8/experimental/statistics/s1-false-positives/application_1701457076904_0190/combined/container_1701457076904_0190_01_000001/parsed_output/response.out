name:dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.queue.limit
value:652962983
relevant log:1-ERROR	ERROR IN CONTACTING RM.java.io.InterruptedIOException: Call interrupted
explanation:The error log indicates an issue with contacting the Resource Manager (RM). The dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.queue.limit configuration option could be related as it controls the queue size for scheduled file's inode ID for satisfying the policy. The current value is significantly higher than the default, which could be causing issues with resource allocation.

name:yarn.app.mapreduce.task.container.log.backups
value:0
relevant log:1-ERROR	ERROR IN CONTACTING RM.java.io.InterruptedIOException: Call interrupted
explanation:The yarn.app.mapreduce.task.container.log.backups configuration option controls the number of backup files for task logs. The current value is set to 0, which means no backups are being created. This could potentially lead to loss of important log information and make error tracking more difficult.

name:yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.algorithm.pool-size
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-ERROR	ERROR IN CONTACTING RM.java.io.InterruptedIOException: Call interrupted
explanation:The yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.algorithm.pool-size configuration option is missing a value. This option controls the pool size for the placement constraints algorithm in the Resource Manager. The missing value could be causing issues with resource allocation, leading to the error in contacting the RM.
