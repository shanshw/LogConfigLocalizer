0,dfs.namenode.startup.delay.block.deletion.sec,0,"The delay in seconds at which we will pause the blocks deletion
    after Namenode startup. By default it's disabled.
    In the case a directory has large number of directories and files are
    deleted, suggested delay is one hour to give the administrator enough time
    to notice large number of pending deletion blocks and take corrective
    action."
1,dfs.datanode.du.reserved,0,"Reserved space in bytes per volume. Always leave this much space free for non dfs use.
      Specific storage type based reservation is also supported. The property can be followed with
      corresponding storage types ([ssd]/[disk]/[archive]/[ram_disk]) for cluster with heterogeneous storage.
      For example, reserved space for RAM_DISK storage can be configured using property
      'dfs.datanode.du.reserved.ram_disk'. If specific storage type reservation is not configured
      then dfs.datanode.du.reserved will be used. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive),
      as described in dfs.blocksize.
      Note: In case of using tune2fs to set reserved-blocks-percentage, or other filesystem tools,
      then you can possibly run into out of disk errors because hadoop will not check those
      external tool configurations."

7,seq.io.sort.factor,100,"The number of streams to merge at once while sorting
      files using SequenceFile.Sorter.
