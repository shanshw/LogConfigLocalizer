name:dfs.blockreport.initialDelay
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0480_m_000009
explanation: The initial delay for the block report is set to 0, which means the report is generated immediately. This could potentially cause issues if the system is not ready to process the report at that time.

name:dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds
value:3
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0480_m_000009
explanation: The namenode computes low redundancy work for datanodes every 3 seconds. If the task is not completed within this interval, it could lead to speculation of the task.

name:dfs.blocksize
value:134217728
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0480_m_000009
explanation: The block size for new files is set to 134217728 bytes. If the task involves processing a file larger than this block size, it could lead to speculation of the task.
