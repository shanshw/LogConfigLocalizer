,name,value,description
0,dfs.blockreport.initialDelay,0,"Delay for first block report in seconds. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If
    no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed"
1,dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds,3,"The periodicity in seconds with which the namenode computes 
  low redundancy work for datanodes. Support multiple time unit suffix(case insensitive),
  as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval."
2,dfs.blocksize,134217728,"The default block size for new files, in bytes.
      You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
      k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
      Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB)."
3,dfs.disk.balancer.block.tolerance.percent,10,"When a disk balancer copy operation is proceeding, the datanode is still
      active. So it might not be possible to move the exactly specified
      amount of data. So tolerance allows us to define a percentage which
      defines a good enough move."
4,dfs.image.transfer.timeout,60000,"Socket timeout for the HttpURLConnection instance used in the image
        transfer. This is measured in milliseconds.
        This timeout prevents client hangs if the connection is idle
        for this configured timeout, during image transfer."
5,dfs.http.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Specify the base amount of time in milliseconds upon which the
    exponentially increased sleep time between retries or failovers
    is calculated for WebHDFS client."
6,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.cancel-timeout,60000,"The amount of time in milliseconds to wait for the output
    committer to cancel an operation if the job is killed"
7,dfs.namenode.path.based.cache.refresh.interval.ms,30000,"The amount of milliseconds between subsequent path cache rescans.  Path
    cache rescans are when we calculate which blocks should be cached, and on
    what datanodes.

    By default, this parameter is set to 30 seconds."
8,yarn.timeline-service.writer.flush-interval-seconds,60,
9,ftp.stream-buffer-size,4096,"The size of buffer to stream files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations."
