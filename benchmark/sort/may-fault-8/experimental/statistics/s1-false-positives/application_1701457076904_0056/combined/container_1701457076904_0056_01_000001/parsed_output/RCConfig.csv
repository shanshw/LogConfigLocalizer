mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records,10000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0056_m_000009,"The log indicates that a speculative task is being added, which could be related to the configuration of how many records are processed during combine output collection before sending a progress notification. If this value is too high, it might cause delays in task speculation."
