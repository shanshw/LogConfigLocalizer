name:file.client-write-packet-size
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0127_m_000009
explanation:The configuration for the packet size for clients to write is missing. This could cause issues with writing tasks.

name:mapreduce.job.running.reduce.limit
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0127_m_000009
explanation:The configuration for the maximum number of simultaneous reduce tasks per job is set to 0. This means there is no limit, which could lead to resource exhaustion.

name:mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version
value:2
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0127_m_000009
explanation:The configuration for the file output committer algorithm version is set to 2. This version has a different behavior for commitTask, recoverTask, and commitJob, which could be causing the issue.
