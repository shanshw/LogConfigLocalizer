name:dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams
value:24y90
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007
explanation:The value of this configuration seems to be incorrect. It should be a numerical value indicating the maximum number of replication streams. The current value "24y90" is not a valid number, which might cause issues in the replication process.

name:yarn.nodemanager.container-log-monitor.total-size-limit-bytes
value:10000000000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007
explanation:The description of this configuration is missing. This configuration sets the total size limit of container logs. If the limit is too high, it might cause storage issues. If it's too low, important log information might be lost.

name:dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second
value:1048576
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007
explanation:This configuration sets the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's block scanner will try to scan from each volume. If this value is set too high, it might cause performance issues. If it's set too low, it might cause delays in the block scanning process.
