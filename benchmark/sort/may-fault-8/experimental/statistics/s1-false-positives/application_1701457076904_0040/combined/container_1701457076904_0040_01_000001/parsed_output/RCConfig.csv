dfs.namenode.replication.max-streams,24y90,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007,"The value of this configuration seems to be incorrect. It should be a numerical value indicating the maximum number of replication streams. The current value ""24y90"" is not a valid number, which might cause issues in the replication process."
yarn.nodemanager.container-log-monitor.total-size-limit-bytes,10000000000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007,"The description of this configuration is missing. This configuration sets the total size limit of container logs. If the limit is too high, it might cause storage issues. If it's too low, important log information might be lost."
dfs.block.scanner.volume.bytes.per.second,1048576,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0040_m_000007,"This configuration sets the number of bytes per second that the DataNode's block scanner will try to scan from each volume. If this value is set too high, it might cause performance issues. If it's set too low, it might cause delays in the block scanning process."
