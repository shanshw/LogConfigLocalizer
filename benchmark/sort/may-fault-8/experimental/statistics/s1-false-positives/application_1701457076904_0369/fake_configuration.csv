0,dfs.namenode.resource.checked.volumes.minimum,,The minimum number of redundant NameNode storage volumes required.
1,yarn.resourcemanager.application.max-tags,10,
2,dfs.datanode.data.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where
  the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or
  symbolic."
3,ha.health-monitor.rpc-timeout.ms,45000,Timeout for the actual monitorHealth() calls.
4,io.map.index.interval,128,"MapFile consist of two files - data file (tuples) and index file
    (keys). For every io.map.index.interval records written in the
    data file, an entry (record-key, data-file-position) is written
    in the index file. This is to allow for doing binary search later
    within the index file to look up records by their keys and get their
    closest positions in the data file."
5,dfs.client.read.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,Threshold in milliseconds for read entries during short-circuit local reads.
6,mapreduce.map.skip.maxrecords,0,"The number of acceptable skip records surrounding the bad
    record PER bad record in mapper. The number includes the bad record as well.
    To turn the feature of detection/skipping of bad records off, set the
    value to 0.
    The framework tries to narrow down the skipped range by retrying
    until this threshold is met OR all attempts get exhausted for this task.
    Set the value to Long.MAX_VALUE to indicate that framework need not try to
    narrow down. Whatever records(depends on application) get skipped are
    acceptable."

8,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups,0,"Number of backup files for the ApplicationMaster logs when using
    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for the ApplicationMaster when both
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups are greater than zero."

  can be speculatively re-executed at any time."
