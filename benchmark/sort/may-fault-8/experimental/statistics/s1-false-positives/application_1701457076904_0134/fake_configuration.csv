0,dfs.namenode.decommission.max.concurrent.tracked.nodes,-0.24363297,"The maximum number of decommission-in-progress or
    entering-maintenance datanodes nodes that will be tracked at one time by
    the namenode. Tracking these datanode consumes additional NN memory
    proportional to the number of blocks on the datnode. Having a conservative
    limit reduces the potential impact of decommissioning or maintenance of
    a large number of nodes at once.
      
    A value of 0 means no limit will be enforced."
1,fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks,4,"Maximum Number of blocks a single output stream can have
    active (uploading, or queued to the central FileSystem
    instance's pool of queued operations.

    This stops a single stream overloading the shared thread pool."
2,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.read.timeout,180000,"Expert: The maximum amount of time (in milli seconds) reduce
  task waits for map output data to be available for reading after obtaining
  connection."
3,dfs.namenode.max-corrupt-file-blocks-returned,100,"The maximum number of corrupt file blocks listed by NameNode Web UI,
      JMX and other client request."

6,dfs.ha.tail-edits.namenode-retries,3,Number of retries to use when contacting the namenode when tailing the log.
7,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.rpc.threads,20,The maximum number of threads to use for calling RPC call to recheck the liveness of dead node.
8,io.seqfile.compress.blocksize,1000000,"The minimum block size for compression in block compressed
          SequenceFiles."
9,dfs.datanode.ec.reconstruct.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the EC reconstruction can utilize for writing.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
