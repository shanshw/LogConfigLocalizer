io.bytes.per.checksum,<missing>,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0398_m_000009,The configuration for 'io.bytes.per.checksum' is missing. This could potentially cause issues with data integrity as the system might not be able to correctly calculate checksums for data blocks.
dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0398_m_000009,"The configuration for 'dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size' is set to 0. This means that no buffer size is set explicitly, which could potentially affect the TCP connection throughput and hence the performance of the system."
dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0398_m_000009,The configuration for 'dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes' is set to 0. This means that the system does not take the number of live datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode during startup. This could potentially cause issues with data availability.
