0,io.bytes.per.checksum,,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.ifile.readahead.bytes,4194304,Configuration key to set the IFile readahead length in bytes.
2,yarn.nodemanager.container-metrics.unregister-delay-ms,10000,
3,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-reset-time-period-ms,10000,"The time period in milliseconds that the allocation count for each array length is
    reset to zero if there is no increment."
4,hadoop.security.kms.client.encrypted.key.cache.expiry,43200000,"Cache expiry time for a Key, after which the cache Queue for this
    key will be dropped. Default = 12hrs"
5,dfs.client.deadnode.detection.probe.suspectnode.threads,10,The maximum number of threads to use for probing suspect node.
6,dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,20,Threshold in milliseconds below which a disk is definitely not slow.
7,dfs.namenode.safemode.min.datanodes,0,"Specifies the number of datanodes that must be considered alive
    before the name node exits safemode.
    Values less than or equal to 0 mean not to take the number of live
    datanodes into account when deciding whether to remain in safe mode
    during startup.
    Values greater than the number of datanodes in the cluster
    will make safe mode permanent."

    thread."
9,dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.recv.buffer.size,0,"Socket receive buffer size for DataXceiver (receiving packets from client
    during block writing). This may affect TCP connection throughput.
    If it is set to zero or negative value, no buffer size will be set
    explicitly, thus enable tcp auto-tuning on some system.
    The default value is 0."
