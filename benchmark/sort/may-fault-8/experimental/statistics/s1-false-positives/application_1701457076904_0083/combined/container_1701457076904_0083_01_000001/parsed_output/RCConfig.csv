dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0083_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative attempt, which is a retry mechanism in Hadoop. The dfs.client.retry.window.base configuration option defines the base time window for these retries. If this value is too low, it may cause excessive retries and impact system performance."

The mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval configuration option defines the maximum amount of time to wait before retrying job end notification. If this value is too low, it may cause premature job termination notifications."
