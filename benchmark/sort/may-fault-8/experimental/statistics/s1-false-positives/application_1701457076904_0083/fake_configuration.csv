0,dfs.datanode.lazywriter.interval.sec,0,Interval in seconds for Datanodes for lazy persist writes.
1,dfs.storage.policy.satisfier.max.outstanding.paths,10000,"Defines the maximum number of paths to satisfy that can be queued up in the
    Satisfier call queue in a period of time. Default value is 10000."
2,dfs.client.retry.window.base,3000,"Base time window in ms for DFSClient retries.  For each retry attempt,
    this value is extended linearly (e.g. 3000 ms for first attempt and
    first retry, 6000 ms for second retry, 9000 ms for third retry, etc.)."
3,fs.s3a.attempts.maximum,20,How many times we should retry commands on transient errors.
4,io.seqfile.compress.blocksize,1000000,"The minimum block size for compression in block compressed
          SequenceFiles."
5,yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms,900000,
6,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-reset-time-period-ms,10000,"The time period in milliseconds that the allocation count for each array length is
    reset to zero if there is no increment."
7,mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval,5000,"The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before
     retrying job end notification. Cluster administrators can set this to
     limit how long the Application Master waits before exiting. Must be marked
     as final to prevent users from overriding this."
8,dfs.block.invalidate.limit,1000,"The maximum number of invalidate blocks sent by namenode to a datanode
    per heartbeat deletion command. This property works with
    ""dfs.namenode.invalidate.work.pct.per.iteration"" to throttle block
    deletions."
9,dfs.qjournal.http.open.timeout.ms,60000,"Timeout in milliseconds when open a new HTTP connection to remote
    journals."
