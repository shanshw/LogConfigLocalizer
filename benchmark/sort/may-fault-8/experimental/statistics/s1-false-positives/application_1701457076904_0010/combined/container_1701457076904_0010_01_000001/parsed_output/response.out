name:dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0010_m_000009
explanation:The configuration dfs.namenode.max.full.block.report.leases is missing a value. This configuration is responsible for preventing the NameNode from being flooded with full block reports that use up all the RPC handler threads. The missing value could cause an overload of the RPC handler threads, leading to the speculation of tasks as seen in the log.

name:mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-no-speculate
value:1000
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0010_m_000009
explanation:The configuration mapreduce.job.speculative.retry-after-no-speculate is set to a low value. This configuration controls the waiting time to do the next round of speculation if there is no task speculated in this round. The low value could lead to frequent speculation of tasks as seen in the log.

name:yarn.nodemanager.opportunistic-containers-max-queue-length
value:0
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0010_m_000009
explanation:The configuration yarn.nodemanager.opportunistic-containers-max-queue-length is set to 0. This configuration controls the maximum queue length for opportunistic containers. The value of 0 could lead to no opportunistic containers being queued, which could affect task scheduling and lead to the speculation of tasks as seen in the log.
