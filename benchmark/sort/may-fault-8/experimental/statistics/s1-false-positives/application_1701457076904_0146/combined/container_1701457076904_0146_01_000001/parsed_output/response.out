name:ftp.blocksize
value:<missing>
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0146_m_000009
explanation:The ftp.blocksize configuration is missing a value. This could potentially cause issues with data transfer, as the system does not know how much data to read or write at a time. This could be the cause of the speculative task mentioned in the log.

name:yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size
value:10
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0146_m_000009
explanation:The yarn.app.mapreduce.am.containerlauncher.threadpool-initial-size configuration is set to 10. This means that the initial size of the thread pool to launch containers in the app master is 10. If the number of tasks exceeds this number, it could lead to task speculation as seen in the log.

name:dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms
value:400
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0146_m_000009
explanation:The dfs.client.block.write.locateFollowingBlock.initial.delay.ms configuration is set to 400. This means that the initial delay for locateFollowingBlock is 400ms. If the delay time increases exponentially for each retry, it could lead to task speculation as seen in the log.
