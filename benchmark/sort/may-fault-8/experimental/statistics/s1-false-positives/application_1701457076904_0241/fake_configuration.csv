0,yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries,0,"The number of retries the client will make for getJob and
    dependent calls.
    This is needed for non-HDFS DFS where additional, high level
    retries are required to avoid spurious failures during the getJob call.
    30 is a good value for WASB"
1,mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.list-status.num-threads,1,"The number of threads to use to list and fetch block locations
  for the specified input paths. Note: multiple threads should not be used
  if a custom non thread-safe path filter is used."
2,dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.buffer.size,128,"Only used when enables asynchronous audit log. Sets the number of audit
    logs allowed in the event buffer before the calling thread is blocked
    (if dfs.namenode.audit.log.async.blocking is true) or until logs are
    summarized and discarded. Default value is 128."
3,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
4,mapreduce.job.max.split.locations,15,"The max number of block locations to store for each split for
    locality calculation."
5,dfs.cachereport.intervalMsec,10000,"Determines cache reporting interval in milliseconds.  After this amount of
    time, the DataNode sends a full report of its cache state to the NameNode.
    The NameNode uses the cache report to update its map of cached blocks to
    DataNode locations.

    This configuration has no effect if in-memory caching has been disabled by
    setting dfs.datanode.max.locked.memory to 0 (which is the default).

    If the native libraries are not available to the DataNode, this
    configuration has no effect."

7,mapreduce.task.combine.progress.records,10000,"The number of records to process during combine output collection
   before sending a progress notification."
8,mapreduce.task.stuck.timeout-ms,600000,"The max timeout before receiving remote task's first heartbeat.
    This parameter is in order to avoid waiting for the container
    to start indefinitely, which made task stuck in the NEW state.
    A value of 0 disables the timeout."
