name:yarn.resourcemanager.delegation-token-renewer.thread-retry-max-attempts
value:10
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0051_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the retry attempts in the ResourceManager. The configuration option 'yarn.resourcemanager.delegation-token-renewer.thread-retry-max-attempts' controls the maximum number of retry attempts, which could be the root cause if the number of attempts exceeds this value.

name:mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level
value:16
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0051_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the shuffle phase in MapReduce. The configuration option 'mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.concurrency-level' controls the concurrency level of the shuffle phase, which could be the root cause if the number of concurrent tasks exceeds this value.

name:seq.io.sort.mb
value:100
relevant log:1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0051_m_000008
explanation: The log indicates a speculative task attempt, which might be related to the sorting phase in MapReduce. The configuration option 'seq.io.sort.mb' controls the buffer memory used for sorting, which could be the root cause if the memory usage exceeds this value.
