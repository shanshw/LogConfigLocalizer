    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
