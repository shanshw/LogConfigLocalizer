0,hadoop.http.idle_timeout.ms,,NN/JN/DN Server connection timeout in milliseconds.

3,mapreduce.job.end-notification.retry.interval,1000,"The number of milliseconds the submitter of the job wants to
    wait before job end notification is retried if it fails. This is capped by
    mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval"
4,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.expire-after-access-minutes,5,"The length of time after an entry is last accessed that it
    should be automatically removed."
5,dfs.namenode.redundancy.queue.restart.iterations,2400,"When picking blocks from the low redundancy queues, reset the
    bookmarked iterator after the set number of iterations to ensure any blocks
    which were not processed on the first pass are retried before the iterators
    would naturally reach their end point. This ensures blocks are retried
    more frequently when there are many pending blocks or blocks are
    continuously added to the queues preventing the iterator reaching its
    natural endpoint.
    The default setting of 2400 combined with the default of
    dfs.namenode.redundancy.interval.seconds means the iterators will be reset
    approximately every 2 hours.
    Setting this parameter to zero disables the feature and the iterators will
    be reset only when the end of all queues has been reached."

9,dfs.datanode.data.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for writing block or pipeline
      recovery when
      BlockConstructionStage is PIPELINE_SETUP_APPEND_RECOVERY or PIPELINE_SETUP_STREAMING_RECOVERY.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
