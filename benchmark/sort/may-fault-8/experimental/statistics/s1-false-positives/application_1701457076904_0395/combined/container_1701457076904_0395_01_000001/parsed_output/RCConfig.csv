dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms,1002208006,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0395_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution, which might be due to slow disk operations. The configuration option 'dfs.datanode.slowdisk.low.threshold.ms' is related to the threshold for slow disk operations. If the threshold is set too high, it might cause unnecessary speculative task executions."
mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0395_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution, which might be due to the lack of user-logs for the task. The configuration option 'mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb' is related to the maximum size of user-logs of each task. If the limit is set to 0, it disables the cap, which might cause issues with task execution."
yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size,1,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0395_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution, which might be due to the limited resources for task scheduling. The configuration option 'yarn.resourcemanager.placement-constraints.scheduler.pool-size' is related to the pool size for task scheduling. If the pool size is set to 1, it might limit the resources for task scheduling, causing speculative task executions."
