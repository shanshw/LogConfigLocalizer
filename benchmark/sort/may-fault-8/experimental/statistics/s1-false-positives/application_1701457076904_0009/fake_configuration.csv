0,io.bytes.per.checksum,1,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,"This property is used only if
  mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed is set to false. In that case,
  this property defines the size of the buffer used in the buffer copy code
  for the shuffle phase. The size of this buffer determines the size of the IO
  requests."
2,httpfs.buffer.size,4096,The size buffer to be used when creating or opening httpfs filesystem IO stream.
3,yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.max-queue-wait-time-ms,100,
4,ha.health-monitor.check-interval.ms,1000,How often to check the service.
5,dfs.block.access.key.update.interval,600,Interval in minutes at which namenode updates its access keys.
6,dfs.client.failover.connection.retries.on.timeouts,0,"Expert only. The number of retry attempts a failover IPC client
    will make on socket timeout when establishing a server connection."
7,dfs.client.short.circuit.replica.stale.threshold.ms,1800000,"The maximum amount of time that we will consider a short-circuit replica to
    be valid, if there is no communication from the DataNode.  After this time
    has elapsed, we will re-fetch the short-circuit replica even if it is in
    the cache."
8,dfs.namenode.checkpoint.max-retries,3,"The SecondaryNameNode retries failed checkpointing. If the 
  failure occurs while loading fsimage or replaying edits, the number of
  retries is limited by this variable."
9,mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources,0,"The maximum number of resources a map reduce job is allowed to
    submit for localization via files, libjars, archives, and jobjar command
    line arguments and through the distributed cache. If set to 0 the limit is
    ignored."
