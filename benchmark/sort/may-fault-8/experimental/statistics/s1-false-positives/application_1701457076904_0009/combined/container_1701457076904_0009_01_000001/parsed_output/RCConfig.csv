mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size,131072,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0009_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution in MapReduce, which involves data shuffling. The configuration 'mapreduce.shuffle.transfer.buffer.size' is directly related to the buffer size used in the shuffle phase. If the buffer size is not properly configured, it may cause inefficiency or errors in the task execution."
yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.max-queue-wait-time-ms,100,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0009_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution in MapReduce, which involves resource management in YARN. The configuration 'yarn.resourcemanager.nm-container-queuing.max-queue-wait-time-ms' is related to the maximum queue wait time for containers in YARN's ResourceManager. If the wait time is too short, it may cause premature task speculation or other scheduling issues."
mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources,0,1-INFO	DefaultSpeculator.addSpeculativeAttempt -- we are speculating task_1701457076904_0009_m_000009,"The log indicates a speculative task execution in MapReduce, which involves job resource localization. The configuration 'mapreduce.job.cache.limit.max-resources' is related to the maximum number of resources a job is allowed to submit for localization. If the limit is set to 0, which means the limit is ignored, it may cause resource overuse or other resource management issues."
