0,io.bytes.per.checksum,0,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,mapreduce.task.timeout,600000,"The number of milliseconds before a task will be
  terminated if it neither reads an input, writes an output, nor
  updates its status string.  A value of 0 disables the timeout."
2,fs.s3a.list.version,2,"Select which version of the S3 SDK's List Objects API to use.  Currently
    support 2 (default) and 1 (older API)."
3,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.commit-window,10000,"Defines a time window in milliseconds for output commit
  operations.  If contact with the RM has occurred within this window then
  commits are allowed, otherwise the AM will not allow output commits until
  contact with the RM has been re-established."
4,dfs.blockreport.initialDelay,0,"Delay for first block report in seconds. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.If
    no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed"
5,fs.s3a.threads.keepalivetime,60,"Number of seconds a thread can be idle before being
    terminated."
6,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."
7,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
8,dfs.client.retry.max.attempts,10,Max retry attempts for DFSClient talking to namenodes.
9,dfs.namenode.blockreport.queue.size,1024,The queue size of BlockReportProcessingThread in BlockManager.
