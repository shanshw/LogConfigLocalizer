0,dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.streams.cache.size,0,"The DFSClient maintains a cache of recently opened file descriptors.
    This parameter controls the maximum number of file descriptors in the cache.
    Setting this higher will use more file descriptors,
    but potentially provide better performance on workloads
    involving lots of seeks."
1,dfs.image.parallel.threads,4,"The number of threads to use when dfs.image.parallel.load is
        enabled. This setting should be less than
        dfs.image.parallel.target.sections. The optimal number of
        threads will depend on the hardware and environment."
2,ipc.maximum.data.length,134217728,"This indicates the maximum IPC message length (bytes) that can be
    accepted by the server. Messages larger than this value are rejected by the
    immediately to avoid possible OOMs. This setting should rarely need to be
    changed."
3,yarn.sharedcache.store.in-memory.check-period-mins,720,
4,dfs.namenode.num.extra.edits.retained,1000000,"The number of extra transactions which should be retained
  beyond what is minimally necessary for a NN restart.
  It does not translate directly to file's age, or the number of files kept,
  but to the number of transactions (here ""edits"" means transactions).
  One edit file may contain several transactions (edits).
  During checkpoint, NameNode will identify the total number of edits to retain as extra by
  checking the latest checkpoint transaction value, subtracted by the value of this property.
  Then, it scans edits files to identify the older ones that don't include the computed range of
  retained transactions that are to be kept around, and purges them subsequently.
  The retainment can be useful for audit purposes or for an HA setup where a remote Standby Node may have
  been offline for some time and need to have a longer backlog of retained
  edits in order to start again.
  Typically each edit is on the order of a few hundred bytes, so the default
  of 1 million edits should be on the order of hundreds of MBs or low GBs.

  NOTE: Fewer extra edits may be retained than value specified for this setting
  if doing so would mean that more segments would be retained than the number
  configured by dfs.namenode.max.extra.edits.segments.retained."
5,dfs.datanode.available-space-volume-choosing-policy.balanced-space-threshold,10737418240,"Only used when the dfs.datanode.fsdataset.volume.choosing.policy is set to
    org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.datanode.fsdataset.AvailableSpaceVolumeChoosingPolicy.
    This setting controls how much DN volumes are allowed to differ in terms of
    bytes of free disk space before they are considered imbalanced. If the free
    space of all the volumes are within this range of each other, the volumes
    will be considered balanced and block assignments will be done on a pure
    round robin basis. Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as
    described in dfs.blocksize."
6,yarn.resourcemanager.zk-delegation-token-node.split-index,0,
7,dfs.short.circuit.shared.memory.watcher.interrupt.check.ms,60000,"The length of time in milliseconds that the short-circuit shared memory
    watcher will go between checking for java interruptions sent from other
    threads.  This is provided mainly for unit tests."
8,mapreduce.reduce.shuffle.retry-delay.max.ms,60000,"The maximum number of ms the reducer will delay before retrying
  to download map data."
9,dfs.namenode.snapshotdiff.listing.limit,1000,"Limit the number of entries generated by getSnapshotDiffReportListing within
    one rpc call to the namenode.If less or equal to zero, at most
    DFS_NAMENODE_SNAPSHOT_DIFF_LISTING_LIMIT_DEFAULT (= 1000) will be sent
    across to the client within one rpc call."
