  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.key.provider.cache.expiry,864000000,DFS client security key cache expiration in milliseconds.
2,hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.directory.search.timeout,10000,"The attribute applied to the LDAP SearchControl properties to set a
    maximum time limit when searching and awaiting a result.
    Set to 0 if infinite wait period is desired.
    Default is 10 seconds. Units in milliseconds."

8,dfs.client.hedged.read.threadpool.size,0,"Support 'hedged' reads in DFSClient. To enable this feature, set the parameter
    to a positive number. The threadpool size is how many threads to dedicate
    to the running of these 'hedged', concurrent reads in your client."
9,hadoop.security.kms.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,2000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers.
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of hadoop.security.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
