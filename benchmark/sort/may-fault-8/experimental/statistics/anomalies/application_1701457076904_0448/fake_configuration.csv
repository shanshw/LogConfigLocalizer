2,dfs.client.write.byte-array-manager.count-threshold,128,"The count threshold for each array length so that a manager is created only after the
    allocation count exceeds the threshold. In other words, the particular array length
    is not managed until the allocation count exceeds the threshold."
3,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
4,mapreduce.task.skip.start.attempts,2,"The number of Task attempts AFTER which skip mode
    will be kicked off. When skip mode is kicked off, the
    tasks reports the range of records which it will process
    next, to the MR ApplicationMaster. So that on failures, the MR AM
    knows which ones are possibly the bad records. On further executions,
    those are skipped."

7,dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis,500,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the base value used in the failover calculation. The
    first failover will retry immediately. The 2nd failover attempt
    will delay at least dfs.client.failover.sleep.base.millis
    milliseconds. And so on."
8,dfs.datanode.data.write.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Specifies the maximum amount of bandwidth that the data transfering can utilize for writing block or pipeline
      recovery when
      BlockConstructionStage is PIPELINE_SETUP_APPEND_RECOVERY or PIPELINE_SETUP_STREAMING_RECOVERY.
      When the bandwidth value is zero, there is no limit."
