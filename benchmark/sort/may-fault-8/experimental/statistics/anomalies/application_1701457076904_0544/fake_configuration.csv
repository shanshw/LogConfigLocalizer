0,hadoop.http.authentication.token.validity,0,"Indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
    to be renewed."
1,hadoop.security.groups.negative-cache.secs,30,"Expiration time for entries in the the negative user-to-group mapping
    caching, in seconds. This is useful when invalid users are retrying
    frequently. It is suggested to set a small value for this expiration, since
    a transient error in group lookup could temporarily lock out a legitimate
    user.

    Set this to zero or negative value to disable negative user-to-group caching."
2,dfs.client.socketcache.capacity,16,"Socket cache capacity (in entries) for short-circuit reads.
    If this value is set to 0, the client socket cache is disabled."
3,mapreduce.input.lineinputformat.linespermap,1,"When using NLineInputFormat, the number of lines of input data
  to include in each split."

5,dfs.edit.log.transfer.bandwidthPerSec,0,"Maximum bandwidth used for transferring edit log to between journal nodes
    for syncing, in bytes per second.
    A default value of 0 indicates that throttling is disabled."

    ContainerRollingLogAppender (CRLA). See
    org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender.maxBackupIndex. By default,
    ContainerLogAppender (CLA) is used, and container logs are not rolled. CRLA
    is enabled for the ApplicationMaster when both
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.limit.kb and
    yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container.log.backups are greater than zero."
9,mapreduce.job.reduces,1,"The default number of reduce tasks per job. Typically set to 99%
  of the cluster's reduce capacity, so that if a node fails the reduces can
  still be executed in a single wave.
