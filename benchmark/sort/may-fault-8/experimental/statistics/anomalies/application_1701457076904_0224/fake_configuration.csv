  at a client. After this period, in milliseconds, the previously excluded node(s) will
  be removed automatically from the cache and will be considered good for block allocations
  again. Useful to lower or raise in situations where you keep a file open for very long
  periods (such as a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) file) to make the writer tolerant to cluster maintenance
  restarts. Defaults to 10 minutes."

    operation (e.g. rename(), delete()) may submit simultaneously for
    execution -excluding the IO-heavy block uploads, whose capacity
    is set in ""fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks""

    All tasks are submitted to the shared thread pool whose size is
    set in ""fs.s3a.threads.max""; the value of capacity should be less than that
    of the thread pool itself, as the goal is to stop a single operation
    from overloading that thread pool."

    Expirations happens when the cluster does not hear from the client within
    the specified session timeout period (i.e. no heartbeat)."
