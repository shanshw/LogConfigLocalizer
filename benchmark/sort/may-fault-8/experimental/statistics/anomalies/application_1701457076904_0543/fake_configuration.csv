0,io.bytes.per.checksum,-1580439267,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,dfs.client.block.reader.remote.buffer.size,512,"The output stream buffer size of a DFSClient remote read. The buffer default value is 512B. The buffer includes
      only some request parameters that are: block, blockToken, clientName, startOffset, len, verifyChecksum,
      cachingStrategy."
2,dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis,15000,"Expert only. The time to wait, in milliseconds, between failover
    attempts increases exponentially as a function of the number of
    attempts made so far, with a random factor of +/- 50%. This option
    specifies the maximum value to wait between failovers. 
    Specifically, the time between two failover attempts will not
    exceed +/- 50% of dfs.client.failover.sleep.max.millis
    milliseconds."
3,dfs.image.transfer.chunksize,65536,"Chunksize in bytes to upload the checkpoint.
        Chunked streaming is used to avoid internal buffering of contents
        of image file of huge size.
        Support multiple size unit suffix(case insensitive), as described
        in dfs.blocksize."
4,dfs.namenode.decommission.interval,30,"Namenode periodicity in seconds to check if
    decommission or maintenance is complete. Support multiple time unit
    suffix(case insensitive), as described in dfs.heartbeat.interval.
    If no time unit is specified then seconds is assumed."
5,dfs.namenode.max.op.size,52428800,Maximum opcode size in bytes.
6,ha.health-monitor.rpc.connect.max.retries,1,"The number of retries on connect error when establishing RPC proxy
    connection to NameNode, used for monitorHealth() calls."
7,fs.ftp.host.port,21,FTP filesystem connects to fs.ftp.host on this port
8,dfs.namenode.get-blocks.max-qps,20,"The maximum number of getBlocks RPCs data movement utilities can make to
    a NameNode per second. Values less than or equal to 0 disable throttling.
    This affects anything that uses a NameNodeConnector, i.e., the Balancer,
    Mover, and StoragePolicySatisfier."
9,dfs.datanode.http.internal-proxy.port,0,"The datanode's internal web proxy port.
    By default it selects a random port available in runtime."
