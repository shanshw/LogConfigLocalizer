value:3
relevant log:2-1-ERROR	Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The OutOfMemoryError could be causing the job to fail and retry. The 'yarn.app.mapreduce.client.job.max-retries' configuration option is set to 3, which means the job will retry 3 times before failing. This could be causing additional strain on the system, leading to the OutOfMemoryError.
