0,io.bytes.per.checksum,472103714,"The number of bytes per checksum.  Must not be larger than
  io.file.buffer.size."
1,yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.committer.commit-window,10000,"Defines a time window in milliseconds for output commit
  operations.  If contact with the RM has occurred within this window then
  commits are allowed, otherwise the AM will not allow output commits until
  contact with the RM has been re-established."
2,ipc.server.max.connections,0,"The maximum number of concurrent connections a server is allowed
    to accept. If this limit is exceeded, incoming connections will first fill
    the listen queue and then may go to an OS-specific listen overflow queue.
    The client may fail or timeout, but the server can avoid running out of file
    descriptors using this feature. 0 means no limit."
3,mapreduce.shuffle.pathcache.expire-after-access-minutes,5,"The length of time after an entry is last accessed that it
    should be automatically removed."
4,mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb,0,The maximum size of user-logs of each task in KB. 0 disables the cap.
5,mapreduce.map.maxattempts,4,"Expert: The maximum number of attempts per map task.
  In other words, framework will try to execute a map task these many number
  of times before giving up on it."
6,dfs.datanode.data.dir.perm,700,"Permissions for the directories on on the local filesystem where
  the DFS data node store its blocks. The permissions can either be octal or
  symbolic."
7,ipc.ping.interval,60000,"Timeout on waiting response from server, in milliseconds.
  The client will send ping when the interval is passed without receiving bytes,
  if ipc.client.ping is set to true."
8,fs.s3a.connection.request.timeout,0,"Time out on HTTP requests to the AWS service; 0 means no timeout.
    Measured in seconds; the usual time suffixes are all supported

    Important: this is the maximum duration of any AWS service call,
    including upload and copy operations. If non-zero, it must be larger
    than the time to upload multi-megabyte blocks to S3 from the client,
    and to rename many-GB files. Use with care.

    Values that are larger than Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds are
    converged to Integer.MAX_VALUE milliseconds"

       in the namenode in milliseconds."
