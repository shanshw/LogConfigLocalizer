name:io.bytes.per.checksum
value:2034001868
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of io.bytes.per.checksum is too large, which may cause the Java heap space to run out of memory. 

name:dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size
value:0
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of dfs.datanode.transfer.socket.send.buffer.size is set to 0, which means no buffer size will be set explicitly. This may affect the TCP connection throughput and cause the system to run out of memory.

name:tfile.fs.output.buffer.size
value:262144
relevant log:2-1-ERROR Thread Thread[eventHandlingThread,5,main] threw an Error.  Shutting down now...java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
explanation: The value of tfile.fs.output.buffer.size is relatively large, which may consume a lot of memory and cause the Java heap space to run out of memory.
